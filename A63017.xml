            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He written Papers of this Booke, originally under the Authors owne hand, did accidentally fall under my view, by meanes of a faithfull friend and brother, who firſt gave me intelligence that there was ſuch a work in hand but not as yet perfected; &amp; afterward obtaining a ſight of it in its primary engroſſings, he borrowed the ſame for a time, in which he might peruſe and reade them over, and ſo in the interim, before they were returned to the owner, they came to me, the which when I had conſidered, I found therein a compoſure of very excellent matter, the Doctrine of the Law of God truly publiſhed in its lightening luſtre, and native puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, drawne forth from under the vailing gloſſes with which it lay co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered (the meere Inventions of Sathan transformed into an Angell of light) and reſtored to its former integritie, and proper uſe;<note place="margin">Pſal. 12.</note> as Silver, tryed in a furnace of earth purified ſeaven times: So that <hi>Sinah's</hi> Thunderclapps, or the bolts of <hi>Horeb</hi> doe here appeare Shot out, the cloudes and Phariſaicall expoſitions (darkening the counſell of God by words without knowledge) being diſſolved and broken tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.<note place="margin">Job 38.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And moreover, that the fainting ſinner might not utterly be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, I found comprized therein, the bringing to light of life and immortality through the Goſpell, the opening of the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the doores being largely expanded in Christs owne way,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.</note> and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of preaching; which reaſon, and the ſeede of the Serpent ſowen therein (the enemie to the ſimple truth of God) hath endeavoured by all ſubtile workings, and ſecret inſinuations, either wholly to ſhut, or elſe to open, and but to the halfe, by the key of ſuch qualifications, that there is no poſſibility for any heart ſenſibly diſcovered, by the doore ſo opened, to enter in: Onely the hypocrite, who lives in a fooles paradiſe, (fraighted with a vaine imagination of his owne conditionall goodneſſe) doth conceitedly ſeeme to himſelfe to enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

               <note place="margin">Iſa. 50.

Coloſ. 1. Iſaiah 6.1. Rev. 1. Eph. 5. Eph. 1. Acts 15. Rom. 8.</note> ſo that what they have or enjoy doth proceed and iſſue from that Root ſo full of moyſture; of which fulneſſe they receive, and grace for grace: They live, but it is in him who is their life: They are righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and that compleatly, but its through his Robes: They are clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and waſhed, but it is by his Bloud: They are accepted, but it is in the Beloved: They are adopted, but it is in the firſt begotten among many Brethren: Their Hearts are purified, but it is by the faith of the Son of God: They are free from Condemnation, but it is becauſe they are in Chriſt Jeſus; for to ſuch there is no condemnation. Nay, reckon up all their participations, and we ſhall finde that they are in, and proceed from him who is the head;<note place="margin">Coloſs. 1.</note> that in all things he might have
<pb facs="tcp:53450:3"/>the preheminence. So that, What have they, but they have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it? And a believing man may ſay moſt truely, In Chriſt I have and am all things, but out of him I am meerly nothing, nay leſs than nothing and vanity.</p>
            <p>And why ſhould this Doctrine be ſo impugned? (but that the ſtrong man armed and keeping his houſe, will not be quiet, for feare he ſhould be diſpoſſeſſed; but by all means poſſible, both as Fox and Lyon beſtirres himſelf, that he may keep and retain his ancient hold) when as it ought rather to be highly extolled and magnified, in Heart, Preſs, and Pulpit,<note place="margin">Mic. 4.</note> ſeeing it lifts up and eſtabliſheth the mountaine of the houſe of the Lord in the top of the mountaines, and exalts it above the hills, and doth but fulfill that ſaying of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> where the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeakes in the perſon of God himſelfe,<note place="margin">Iſa. 52.</note> Behold <hi>my Servant</hi> (mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Chriſt) <hi>ſhall deale prudently, he ſhall be exalted, extolled, and ſhall be very high,</hi> though many ſhould be aſtoniſhed at him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his viſage (not appearing comely to the eye of fl ſh and blood) was ſo marred more than any man, and his forme more than the Sons of men. But what God in Himſelfe, or his Word, hath most highly exalted, that Sathan (alwayes an enemy to the truth of God, and the ſeed of the Woman) doth endeavour to depreſſe and stifle under foot: But <hi>Maugre,</hi> all his enmity, the truth will break out from amongst all the thick clouds of ſlanders, and neither by his power nor policy ſhall be ſuppreſſed for he can but touch its heele:<note place="margin">Iſa 11.</note> the Enſigne muſt be lift up for the distreſſed of the Nations to repaire unto and his reſt ſhall be glorious; and he cannot let it, for its the worke of God in which he will be glorified, ſo that although the enemie come in like a floude, yet the Spirit of the Lord ſhall lift up a ſtandard againſt him or put him to flight. But becauſe he is the accuſer of the brethren day and night, therefore he will never be quiet, but will returne afreſh with a new encounter, ſo that it can never be expected, that a truce ſhall be ſtricken, and a reall peace concluded betweene the ſeed of the Woman and of the Serpent, or that the child of the fleſh will be at reſt and ſit ſtill whilſt he is in the recovery and view of the promiſed ſeed, or the child that is borne after the ſpirit. But what matter? for he that keepes <hi>Iſrael</hi> neither ſlumbers nor ſleepes, and theſe do but crack the ſhell (if ſo much) but cannot reach to the kernell. And the greateſt enemies are thoſe within, of a mans own houſhhold which ſolace them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the outward, but are a bane to the inner man, which daily
<pb facs="tcp:53450:4"/>accompany us, and are our boſome companions, nouriſhed up together in and with us, and yet little do we perceive them.</p>
            <p>I having lighted upon this worke, and perceiving the maine ſcape thereof to tend to a vindication, and clearing of the bare and naked truth of God from aſperſions of obloquie caſt thereon, and ſuch gloſſes under which it lay obſcured, &amp; a plain patheticall and free publiſhing of the Goſpell, as the veine of good tidings, through which the bloud of Chriſt runnes freely to ſinners, did ſet pen to paper, and copy it out; and having ſo done, I returned the originall draught to the owner, but expecting a good while its coming forth in another garment to publike view under the Authours owne papers, and not hearing any thing of it, and the Authour living at a diſtance from me, I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraide leſt the child, through theſe nationall cumbers and troubles of late, ſhould have beene ſmothered in the wombe, and not have beene produced to light in a current hue to the Judgement of all, that men might trie all things, but hold faſt that which is good. And thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I endeavoured that thou mighteſt have a ſight thereof in this ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, in which it is now preſented to thee, by making uſe of my owne papers. From the which if thou ſhalt (through Gods giving of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe) receive the leaſt profit, though but as a graine of muſtard-ſeede, or ſatisfaction by the cleare light of the truth it ſelfe, in any one of the controverſies agitated in the enſuing diſcourſe, I know that the Authour will therein exceedingly rejoyce; delighting if in any thing he may be beneficiall to the Church, or the leaſt in the Church of God. And I ſhall alſo receive the full recompence of my labour, if in the leaſt manner I or rather God by me (as a weake inſtrument) ſhould be pleaſed to doe any good, who am leſſe than the leaſt of all his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is a little book called <hi>The Aſſertion of Grace,</hi> printed without my privity by ſome welwiſhers to <hi>the truth as it is in Jeſus,</hi> (if yet thou haſt ſeen it:) That, with Dr. <hi>Criſp</hi>'s Sermons, and the <hi>Honey comb,</hi> being thronged with pikes of deſpite ever ſince their publication, have occaſioned this <hi>Re-aſſertion,</hi> to reſcue and vindicate (if it be poſſible) the credit and truth of each, wherein they have too long ſuffered.</p>
            <p>The times are ſo frowning, and the fiery ſpirit of Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo overſwaying, that I cannot promiſe, but rather do fear the not-printing of it. The Author is (as that faithful Martyr, <hi>Englands Apostle,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> calls him, ſaid of himſelf) <hi>ill-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to the world-ward,</hi> more deſpiſed then the hateful Bat; yet he caſteth it upon the venture, (as was <hi>Moſes</hi> on the water.) Providence may ſo over-rule and order, that ſomething of God appearing in it, with which being enamour'd, one or other may befriend it with a Printed-publication. But if it have not free paſſage, let it ſhame the Adverſaries, being a witneſs of my confidence, but of their fear.</p>
            <p>This is the grand Controverſie in our Land this day. The bloody ſword hath paſs'd thorow it. The Prerogative Royal,
<pb facs="tcp:53450:6"/>our Subject-liberties, eſtates, lives, are laid at the ſtake: But Free-grace is the richeſt and chief-Diamond belonging to the Crown of our King Jeſus; and what are all theſe that we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard or can loſe, to our ſpiritual freedom, peace of conſcience, everlaſting life, and that exceeding glorious condition in Gods Kingdom! The loſs of one ſoul, the damnation of it in hell, is more conſiderable then all theſe; yea, if thou adde the whole worlds worth, it cannot by them all be ranſomed. Church-government is a fair flower, in its native and original purity, if ſo it could be happily planted, and made to grow: but this is the Prime-roſe of the Church-garland. What is Diſcipline to Doctrine? the moral and temporary education, to the ſpiritual regeneration, and endleſs bleſſedneſs? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, I am in the loweſt Claſſis, the weakeſt and unfitteſt of all to undertake and manage this quarrel: I could wiſh it were done with far more dexterity, by one furniſhed with better gifts and leaſure. But I ſee a Providence herein: no man ſhews himſelf willing: I am engaged: and it is ordinary with the Lord to perfect his power in humane weakneſs. The inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can want no vertue or efficacie, which he will uſe, to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect what he is pleaſed. Beſides, there is a prevalent, yea omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent power in Truth it ſelf, when it ſhews forth its native luſtre. All his adverſaries could not reſiſt the wiſdom in <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen.</hi> Theſe men came forth <hi>Goliah</hi>-like, full of ſtomack, and with reſolution to lay all level with the earth; <hi>Down with them,</hi> down with theſe Antinomians, and ſons of Belial, even to the ground. But like ſome Meteors, that give a fiery flaſh of light a ſhort time, and for want of matter are forthwith ſpent and extinguiſhed: ſo theſe Champions ſpirits are now much cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and their courage abated. Look now on them, whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at a diſtance defied the invincible Verity, how preſently upon the firſt Onſet their eyes be ſore dazled, and their mindes dazed, with the glory and preſence of it! Like them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 48.4,
<pb facs="tcp:53450:6"/>5, 6. they ſeem half vanquiſhed already: What may a few more rays and beams effect? I hope ere long to ſee my deſire, <hi>viz.</hi> the Truth cleared, and received in love by both ſides, and our ſelves happily fought to be friends. O our God! this is eaſie with thee. In the interim, do they not decline the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, and yeeld in great part what was contended for? For, 1. Now they aſſert not that the Law is without a condemning power, but that it doth not actually condemn a believer. 2. The Covenant (though oppoſed at firſt) is now not properly condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, ſaith Mr. <hi>Rutherf.</hi> the whole of it lieth on God, and is given and wrought of meer free grace. 3. The Law was ſaid to be the inſtrument of Regeneration and Converſion: but Mr. <hi>Burgeſs</hi> is brought to this, That it is a practical and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive mean appointed to work, <hi>at leaſt in ſome degree,</hi> that which is commanded. Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> giveth it a tender touch, as if he were afraid or unwilling to meddle much with it.</p>
            <p>And they are pleaſed to miſtake the controverted points, and ſo to quarrel for what we never aſſerted, nor queſtioned: as, 1. They contend for the inherencie of ſin after juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Who denied it? 2. That Chriſt was not intrinſecally and actively a ſinner. But who ever affirmed ſo horrid a blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy? 3. That believers are ſubject to the Croſs. 4. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are to hate ſin, as ſin, though freed from the peril of condemnation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now who fight they againſt? they may ſeek their adverſaries. 5. We decry duties, ſay they; are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Repentance; teach that the Law is of no uſe; would caſt it out of the Church. But where do they read or finde theſe? The Accuſer of the brethren can help them to enough of the like ſtamp.</p>
            <p>Alſo, in many other of the main things they ſtrangely ſhuffle and ſhift in the buſineſs: for though they make a fair flouriſh in the eyes of the ſimpler ſort, who are not able to look tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly into them; yet a judicious ſpirit ſeeth their arguments
<pb facs="tcp:53450:7"/>without nerves, or their grounds to be ſandie and failing. And Mr. <hi>Burgeſs</hi> (above all) hath deviſed unheard-of diſtinctions, and much quaint Divinity, all to ſupport their rotten and totte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring tenets. And it is no ſin with them to bely, diſguiſe us, and with open mouth to declaim againſt us, as Antinomians, ſons of Belial, Seducers, Libertines, diſobedient, unholy, profane, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are our genuine epithets,<note place="margin">Doctor <hi>Tayler.</hi>
               </note> and right cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, ſaith their prime Doctor. Such lyes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities, and falſhoods, either are no breaches of their law, or it wanteth power to condemn them: they are priviledged for impunity. But this is to beget and breed miſconceits, and undeſerved hatred of our perſons in the mindes of people, that ſo the truth of doctrine may be ſuſpected and deſpiſed. But whoſo is wiſe will ſee with his own eyes, and not receive all by tradition. When ſhalt thou learn the pure and genuine Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant doctrine, of a faithleſs Papiſt?</p>
            <p>Laſtly, The manor of their proceeding againſt us doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincingly argue their great diffidence in their Cauſe. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Motions for a loving and brotherly meeting and confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, or to write <hi>pro &amp; con,</hi> or to ſet down the chief tenets of both ſides, that ſo they might be ſeen and examined, have ſtill been refuſed; whenas for number they were ten to one. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we muſt go in their way without queſtion or ſcruple of any thing, or <hi>Out with us.</hi> Theſe are their own words.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Being writ unto, they would not anſwer. Yet certain of their noted diſciples have with oily words come and urged me, as the Jews did Chriſt, to ſpeak many things, ſtill ſaying they intended me no harm; I muſt not have ſuch a thought of them: and at our parting gave me the hand never to open their mouth more againſt me. And yet the next news was, (can you credit me?) that out of our Conference, miſconſtruing and perverting what was ſaid, they had compiled and exhibited to the Biſhop eighteen Propoſitions or Articles. By this kinde
<pb facs="tcp:53450:7"/>of Miniſters and Profeſſors (who can ſet a fair gloſs on all their doings, pretending much of God, and for his Law) I have been brought into divers Courts, and into the High-Commiſſion-Court, where I was twice impriſoned, my Miniſtery reſtrained, and I compelled to attend the Court two yeers together: and all that while, nothing was proved, no adverſary would ſhew his face. At laſt, I was diſmiſſed, nothing worthy the leaſt puniſhment being found in me. Afterward, a Miniſter in <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſhire</hi> excepted againſt my Sermon, termed it <hi>A diſh of poyſon;</hi> and being much preſſed, through the importunity of one yeer, a Gentleman prevailed ſo far, that I ſhould know my error be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore four Divines of his own chuſing, ſo that they might be Judges. Motion was made, that I might name one; but it would not be granted. And the error was, that I ſaid <hi>the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace was abſolute and free in reſpect of man.</hi> The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines were to his minde; he knew that beforehand: And they ſaid I was in the error. I deſired to know the Condition. The graveſt and prime of them (now ſcarce <hi>ulli ſecundus</hi> in the Aſſembly, <hi>uti fertur</hi>) anſwered, that <hi>Good works</hi> was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of it. Then I demanded, What was the condition of the covenant of Works; or wherein they differed? So in ſome paſſion and diſcontent they aroſe, and we parted. This was in the Prelates time. So not long after, I was cited again to <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> where I found an odious black Bill exhibited by Sir <hi>John Lucifuga.</hi> Since that, I was ſummoned before the Miniſters at <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> where they charged me with old things. I told them, 1. I was falſly accus'd. 2. I had given ſatisfaction to the Court. But that ſhould not ſerve to acquit me, ſaid they. And a Miniſter, unknown to me, informed them, that he heard me deliver many <hi>Antinomian</hi> errours in <hi>Stopworth.</hi> Where prove that ever I preached, I would loſe my head. But I deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to know ſome one errour, and could not. They voted me out of my place and Miniſtery, and by vertue of a pretended
<pb facs="tcp:53450:8"/>Ordinance of Parliament, commanded me to leave <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> and would not let me ſtay out my Quarter: yet I did; and then a Writ was procured from the Colonels to apprehend and impriſon me. My offer was, To let me have juſtice, and I would juſtifie what I taught and held, and let them ſee their errours, (an eaſie thing to do:) but they refuſed. Then I went to <hi>London,</hi> with intention to Petition the Parliament: but friends who had better intelligence and experience, diſſwaded and deterred me. So finding little hope of relief, I returned, and removed my family into <hi>Yorkſhire;</hi> ſo giving place to their fiery zeal.</p>
            <p>Gentle Reader, I have preſumed on thy patience, in ſetting down theſe paſſages: by which it is clear, that they ſeek them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and not Chriſt and his Truth; and chuſe rather to uſe Club-law, as did <hi>Cain,</hi> the falſe Prophets, Phariſees, and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites in all times of perſecution, to extinguiſh or ſuppreſs the light of heaven, then that it ſhould diſcover their naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſhame.</p>
            <p>If thou ask, <hi>Why are they bent and enraged more againſt you An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomians, then any other Sect?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> They can tell thee great things; and would have thee believe we are unworthy to live in any Commonwealth. But the truth is, and many of them cannot be ignorant of it, we teach onely what is Orthodox, and the old-received truths of God: And do deſire no more favour, then what Juſtice can deny to none, <hi>viz.</hi> leave to ſpeak for our ſelves, before we be condemned. Onely they ſee the inconſiſtencie of divers of our Tenets with theirs: and Dagon or the Ark muſt fall: And how queſtionable and unjuſtifiable their aſſertions are to any indifferent capacity, viewing and conſidering them in the true light, and therefore would put out our Candie. It would make a Chriſtian face to bluſh, or his heart rather to bleed, to
<pb facs="tcp:53450:8"/>hear what ſtuff they can put off and vent in their Sermons. I reſorted to their Exerciſes divers yeers, yet never heard one doctrine of Free-grace, of Chriſt, Faith, or Juſtification: Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Reformation is taken for Regeneration and Evangelical Sanctification. I have ſpoken with old and zealous proſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, who knew not what it was to be juſtified by faith, except this was the meaning of it, That God would accept of them for their good works and duties. If any one (which yet Nature is principled for) be framed and brought ſomwhat into a Legal way, &amp; to performances, he is judged a true Convert, and may ſet up his reſt. If they do well, they tell you they can believe ſufficiently: upon their kinde of works they build their faith. The Law is not preached as the miniſtry of death, to caſt down and to kill, that Chriſt may be the life and ſpiritual reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: but the life that moſt ſpeak of, is to live and walk in the Law: yet <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I by the Law am dead to the Law, that I may live to God,</hi> Gal. 2.19. I am reſolved of this that if people had experience of a ſenſible death working in them by the Law, and that nothing but the curſe and wrath could be had in their works and ways; and had felt as ſenſibly a reviving and quickning in the faith and apprehenſion of Chriſt, there would be little ground of difference remaining: but till that be, or at leaſt, that the Law be preached for death, and not for life and peace, as too many do, how can the controverſie be ended?</p>
            <p>But fleſh and blood may object, <hi>What good ſucceſs can I promiſe to this my enterpriſe? I go againſt the full tyde and violent current of humane policie and learning of ſuch a religious multitude, all being combined and conſpiring against me. Are not my adverſaries in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber infinite, rarely qualified, admired for ſanctity and zeal, backed and inveſted with worldly Authority, countenanced by the times, and the ſole-eſteemed pillars of the Church? What am I? how dare I oppoſe them? Who is my Patron?</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:53450:9"/>
            <p>My anſwer is, 1. I do not come forth in mine own name or ſtrength, nor meaſure my ſelf with them; for then hope of prevailing is gone. But when God is ſet againſt them, and his invincible Verity, ſo oppoſed by them, how vain and light then are all theſe powers and excellencies? 2. I have been carried againſt the ſtream almoſt theſe twenty yeers, yet they could not prevail, by reaſon of the Lords ſtrength and preſence. 3. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the voyage fall out, I have not much left to loſe, onely my outward liberty in part, and a few days, it may be, of my natural life can be in jeopardy. And hath the ſacred Truth of God, and the deſired good of his Church been ſo prevalent, that for their ſakes I have ſuſtained ſuch loſs, ſuffered ſo many things already; and ſhall I now ſhrink, or be unwilling to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice the loan of what is remaining? The Lord leave me not to that temptation. 4. In all their oppoſition, I ſee nothing to convince, but am rather thereby confirmed. They would ſee a mote in Dr. <hi>Criſp</hi>'s eye, but will not ſee a beam in their own. If to my ſelf I were guilty of any their unworthy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations, or of doing or yet offering a hundredth part of that wrong I received from them; or if my conſcience did not wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with me, that I had ſought to give unto them all poſſible ſatisfaction, more then was deſired, or would be accepted of; then I ſhould not have that inward peace and contentment which now I enjoy. And 5. laſtly, why ſhould I deſire a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, and ſo become injurious to any in engaging them, or ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering them to be ſuſpected? I know the Truth is able to protect it ſelf, and the ſervant of it: and further then I am found in the way of Verity, I ſeek no ſhelter. <hi>The Name of the Lord is a ſtrong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is ſafe.</hi> Prov. 18.10. <hi>Thou Lord hast ſeen it; for thou beholdeſt miſchief and ſpite to requite it with thy hand. The poor committeth himſelf unto thee: thou art the helper of the fatherleſs.</hi> Pſal. 10.14.</p>

                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> I ſtand muſing at this your Novel-aſſertion, That the Moral Law (for of this you will have us to underſtand you, not of the Ceremonal) doth include Chriſt; whereas the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.21. <hi>That the righteouſneſs of Faith is revealed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Law:</hi> And <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.11. <hi>The Law is not of Faith.</hi> Now if the Doctrine of Chriſtian Righteouſneſs and Faith be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Law, I ſee not how Chriſt ſhould be there included. And yet you preſently add, <hi>It's true, the righteouſneſs of the Law and that of the Goſpel differ</hi> toto coelo: <hi>We muſt place one in</hi> ſuprema parte coeli, <hi>and the other in</hi> ima parte terrae. <hi>as Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Now I thus argue: 1. Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs are inſeparable: If Chriſts Righteouſneſs (which is the only Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the Goſpel) be as far above, and out of the bounds of the Law, as the higheſt part of Heaven is diſtant from the loweſt part of the Earth, then it is impoſſible that Chriſt ſhould any way be included in the Law. Or, 2. You will make the Law more capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and of far larger extent, then is the righteouſneſs of it; ſo that the righteouſneſs of the Law muſt be kept below, but the Law it ſelf filleth Heaven and Earth, or is above as well as below, even where Chriſt is. This is your New Divinity, a late Upſtart. It is ſtrange to ſee what ſhifts you are often put unto and how to ſtrain your wits (if not conſcience alſo;) for as you want no good-will to maintain and uphold the tot ring Miniſtry and Doctrine of your Party, ſo perceiving Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> and others in a way ſcarce juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable, and to uſe Arguments and diſtinctions not ſolid, and inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to convince the Adverſary or to confirm your Opinions, you are thus reſolved to go in an unbeaten and new-found path, in hope to effect your deſire. But to proceed. And know alſo that your ſaid Author, Dr. <hi>Luther,</hi> ſaith, <hi>That Chriſt is no more in the Law, nor yet the Chriſtian, then Chriſt is now in the grave, or Peter in the Priſon.</hi> Again, ſaith he, <hi>A believer is out of the limits of the Law, in another Kingdom,</hi> &amp;c. How far your <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condarily and occaſionally</hi> ſhall be made to extend, or how you will expound them, I know not: you promiſe more hereafter; that is a <hi>ſuperſede as</hi> now.</p>
                     <p>M. <hi>B. It's the hardeſt task in Divinity, to give them</hi> [Law and Goſpel] <hi>their bounds.</hi>

                     <p>M. <hi>B. It's true, if we take Law and Goſpel in this ſtrict difference, as ſome Divines do that all the Precepts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are, muſt be under the Law and all the Promiſes be reduced to the Goſpel, whether in the Old or new Teſtament; in which ſence Divines then ſay,</hi> Lex jubat, &amp; Gratia juvat; <hi>and</hi> Lex imperat, &amp; fides impetrat: <hi>then the Law can have no Sanction by the Promiſe: But where can this be ſhewed in Scripture?</hi>

                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> What ſtruggling is here to evade?

And <hi>to them who by patient continuance in well doing ſeek for glory, and honor, and immortality; is promiſed eternal life, Rom.</hi> 2.7.

But laſtly, If the Spirit do convert, quicken, and give power by the Precepts, and in and by command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, God do convey his grace of Regeneration, (which is your O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion) then this queſtion is to no purpoſe, Whether all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes be reduced to the Goſpel, or not: Neither can it be truly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed then, That the Law is eſtabliſhed by the grace and faith of the Goſpel, which yet is both according to the verity of Scripture, and the Teſtimonies of all Authors, as is already ſhewed. Now let the Reader judg, or your ſelf, whether the Law can have San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction by promiſe, or no.</p>
                     <p>M. <hi>B. I wonder much at an Antinomian Author, ſaying,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53450:11"/>It cannot be a Law, unleſs it alſo be a curſing Law,</hi> Aſſert. of Gr. p. 31. <hi>For beſides that, the ſame Author doth acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg the Moral Law to be a Rule to a Believer; and</hi> regula <hi>hath</hi> vim praecepti, <hi>as well as</hi> doctrinae.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Author you mention doth grant the Law to be a perpetual and inviolable Rule of Righteouſneſs; but that it is a Rule to a Believer, <hi>quatenus talis,</hi> he will not grant. 2. It is true, it hath <hi>vim praecepti</hi> as well as <hi>doctrinae,</hi> and ſo it hath <hi>vim dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandi,</hi> a power to curſe, as he there affirmeth, and you neither have nor can refute.</p>
                     <p>M. <hi>B. What will he ſay to the Law given to Adam, who yet was righteous and innocent, and therefore could not be curſing or condemning of him?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> You mean not, that the Law had no power to curſe and condemn, becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> was innocent; for you grant it had that potentially, though not actually: If then it did not actually curſe, it was not becauſe the Law wanted that power, but in that ſtate of innocency there was no place nor reaſon actually to curſe. Hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth wonder not at the Author for ſaying the Law hath power to curſe (which is denyed by Dr <hi>Taylor</hi> and your ſelf,) but wonder at your own overſight, who while you would oppoſe and confute your Adverſary, do grant and affirm all he requireth: And yet in your Lect. 6. you deny this power to curſe to be any eſſential part of the Law. When <hi>Adam</hi> had ſinned, whether did the Law actually condemn or no? If yes, I demand then, whether it were by that authority and power it had before, or ſome new and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther power was given it upon the fall. Did not the Law ſay to him, yet in innocency, <hi>What day thou eateſt of that tree thou ſhalt dye? Gen.</hi> 2. How was it, that it threatened death, and forbad the eating under ſuch a fearful penalty, if it had yet no power to execute and inflict the ſame? You muſt now yield and ceaſe, or fight on with your own ſhadow.</p>
                     <p>M. <hi>B. In reſpect of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of the Law to Believers: It hath this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> 1. <hi>To excite and quicken them againſt all ſin and corruption, &amp;c. becauſe none of the godly are perfectly righteous, and there is none but may complain of his dull love, and his faint delight in holy things; therefore the Law of God by commanding doth quicken him, &amp;c. Have not Believers

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> The love of God in Chriſt revealed and ſhed abroad in the heart, doth quicken; but the ſimple Command of the Moral Law, can never effect what you ſay: He that loveth the Lord, hateth ſin; but <hi>we love the Lord,</hi> not by reaſon of the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring it, but <hi>becauſe he hath loved us firſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.19. and that we be born of God, and know God in his Son. It's ſtrange Divinity, that the fleſh and wickedneſs of our nature ſhould be cured or weakened by the Law: It may diſcover the malady or diſeaſe, but not remedy it: Put the Law to the old man, it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive and quicken it indeed, but not to goodneſs, if we may believe either Scripture, or our own experience. <hi>The ſtrength of ſin is the Law:</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.56. And <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9. <hi>When the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment came, ſin revived, and I dyed.</hi> Such is the poyſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful enmity in us by the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> that it maketh head againſt the plaiſter of the Law, being applyed unto it: The old man or fleſh is enmity to God, and all goodneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. and the more it is ſtirred and quickened by the Law, the more it is enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: But contrarily, the Head of the Body (that is, the Church) is Chriſt, from whom it hath nouriſhment miniſtred, and ſo increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth with the encreaſe of God; and by this means the body of ſin is weakened and aboliſhed, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.19. Our Sanctification is not begun nor perfected by legal precepts and preſſings, but by our true and effectual union with Chriſt; <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.4. <hi>As the branch cannot bear fruit of it ſelf, except it abide in the Vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.</hi> Verſe 5. <hi>He that abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in me, and I in him, the ſame bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> It may be truly ſaid, that too many ſo preach the Law, that they eſtabliſh mans righteouſneſs: for this is in the mouth of divers; The Miniſter ſaith, <hi>Do well, and have well;</hi> and we are taught, <hi>That the way to come to glory in Heaven, is to glorifie God on Earth by good works: Chriſt ſaveth none but holy ones, &amp;c.</hi> If the Law were uſed to diſcover ſin, not to cover it; to weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and deſtroy, not to ſtrengthen and build up; to binde and caſt
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53450:12"/>out, not to looſe, releaſe and admit: if the Vail were taken off <hi>Moſes</hi> face, and the glory of God in his fiery and terrible Law did break forth, ſo that all found it to be a Miniſtration of death and condemnation; this would be a mean to kill and overthrow all ſelf-confidence and boaſting: But who doth make that uſe of it? Not one of twenty: and your ſelf cannot receive the Law and digeſt it under ſuch a terrifying and damning notion.</p>
                     <p>M. <hi>B.</hi> pag. 11. <hi>The Antinomian, before he ſpeaks any thing againſt or about the Law, muſt ſhew in what ſence the Apoſtle uſeth it.</hi>

The Scripture maketh the guilt and curſe to redound upon the perſon, as <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Curſed is every man that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth not in all things which are written in the Book of the Law, to do them.</hi> 2. In your dayly repentance, or confeſſion you make in your prayers, do you not judg and condemn your ſelf for your ſins, whereof Conſcience doth accuſe you? What a ſtrange expreſſion is it, that <hi>ſins are guilty of Gods wrath?</hi> 3. If no guilt redound upon the perſon, there is no more need of Chriſts blood to cleanſe, acquit and juſtifie, and to be a continual propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation for ſin: The Promiſe is vain, and Faith of no effect, unleſs you will ſay, that you believe dayly to ſecure, not your perſon, but your ſins from wrath. 4. And the true reaſon why the ſin, guilt and curſe redound upon any perſon, is, becauſe he is put and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced under the Law, which revealeth wrath; and why all is kept off the Believer, it is not becauſe the Law hath loſt its power to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53450:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>and condema, as you would bear us in hand, but becauſe he is <hi>not under the Law, but under Grace, Rom.</hi> 6.14. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. Chriſt hath ſatisfied for him, taking all his ſins, guilt and curſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to and upon himſelf, and God hath juſtified and ſet him free; ſo he liveth in peace and at reſt by Faith in Chriſt, who loved him, and gave himſelf to redeem him. Alſo the grace and benefit of his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification doth in ſome ſort redound upon the actions of a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: For was it not by his Faith that <hi>Abels</hi> ſacrifice pleaſed God? <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.4. There is no ſuch purity, perfection or dignity in the beſt thing you can do, which of it ſelf, ſimply conſidered, can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure or finde acceptance with God. The Scripture and all Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Divinity do hold forth Chriſt only as the ground and reaſon of all acceptation of man, his works and ways: 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Ye are an holy Prieſthood, to offer up ſpiritual ſacrifice, accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> You ſay Dr <hi>Criſp</hi> is wide, and ſee not your ſelf out of the way of Truth and Charity. A man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der grace is no more under the Law; he is dead to the Law, that he may live to God: <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.19.</p>
                     <p>M. <hi>B.</hi> 6 Caution. <hi>Law is not to be decryed, becauſe we have no power to keep the Law.</hi>

                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> Who cryeth down, or ſpeaketh againſt the Law? You cannot ſhew or name any. And who are ſo much againſt the Law as your ſelves, who are become vain and needleſs Advocates for it? The blinde Phariſees pretended moſt zeal for God and his Law, who were yet in the ſtate of enmity; and by reaſon of their inward malice and envy againſt Chriſt, oppoſition and hatred of the truth of his Doctrine, falſe accuſations, and ſeeking to entangle and bring him into danger, they lived in the continual breach of the Law. Well, it is too evident, that you, with thouſand others of your Fraternity, ceaſe not to quarrel with, except againſt, and to condemn us for <hi>Antinomians,</hi> and yet no demonſtrative proof is extant of any ſuch Error or guilt. It is eaſie to lay on load of accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation upon Innocency it ſelf (hence ſuch aſperſions and indignities caſt upon <hi>David, Paul,</hi> and that immaculate Lamb <hi>Chriſt</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) if the corrupt heart within give way, and be bent thereunto: <hi>How weak is thy heart, ſeeing thou haſt done all theſe things! Ezek.</hi> 16. The weakeſt and worſt ſort have been the moſt zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and confident accuſers. <hi>We know,</hi> ſay the <hi>Jews, that this

They anſwered. If he were not a Malefactor, we would not have delivered him unto thee, Ioh.</hi> 18.29.30. If ſo many of that Religion ſay it, it is unqueſtionably true, though there be no reality nor jot of verity in the accuſation; yet know it, that it is an <hi>Antinomian</hi> part to ſlander and miſcal, and to make no crime to appear. Thus may the greateſt delinquency and guilt of <hi>Antinomianiſm</hi> be layd at yours and your fellows doors. <hi>There is one that accuſeth you, even Moſes, in whom you truſt; Joh.</hi> 5.45.</p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Doth the Doctor in this ſaying decry the Law? Your own words, and judgment too, do import the like impoſſibility. What a ſiniſter minde is this? But all, if voyd of prejudice and partiality, may clearly ſee by this his expreſſion, that Doctor <hi>Criſps</hi> main deſire, deſign and ſcope was to inſtruct, erect and comfort a poor diſtreſſed and troubled Soul, and that therefore he ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed and miniſtred Goſpel-Cordials. Obſerve the ground and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his words, <hi>[if thou be troubled for ſin,]</hi> and then you have no cauſe ſo to reprove and cenſure him as you do. 2. His coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and direction differ much from theirs of your way, who in ſuch a caſe bid the dejected man to deſire promiſe, and endeavor his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to do and walk according to the Law, and ſo put him in hope of mercy, in that (as it is taught) the Law is mitigated, Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized, God accepteth the will for the deed, &amp;c. The Doctor wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly telleth him of the impoſſibility of making his peace that way (knowing alſo how apt every one is to take that courſe) that ſo he may utterly deſpair of himſelf, ſelf-doings, and active righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and more readily hearken to the voyce and tydings of the Goſpel only. And 3. though to believe be as impoſſible to mans natural power, yet it followeth not, but that he is rightly put upon
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53450:14"/>the believing the Goſpel; as <hi>Paul</hi> did bid the Jaylor, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. <hi>to believe in the Lord Jeſus, that he might be ſaved.</hi> The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving way is the only way of life, peace, and Salvation; and the Goſpel is to be preached for the obedience of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.5.

I think that the expreſſion which occaſioneth ſo much admiration in you, is either D <hi>Criſps,</hi> or ſome other reputed <hi>Antinomians,</hi> and his words are Allegorical: Though <hi>Pauls</hi> friends had free acceſs, and might miniſter unto him, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.23. yet many a Martyr in <hi>Queen Maries</hi> time had not that favor: So the Law, being a ſpiritual Jaylor to the Conſcience, ſuffereth none in a Legal way to comfort it; no work, no duty, performance, or reformation; nor man, nor Angel. The Law came by <hi>Moſes,</hi> but Grace, Pardon, Peace, Favor, Life, Conſolation, by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 2. That place, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.23. doth ſufficiently confirm it, and hath been uſed for that purpoſe by ſuch Divines as you have no exception a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt. 3.

Secondly, Grant that it is meant of all, even the <hi>fathers</hi> alſo under that regiment, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Hiſtory, and it is true that they had no comfort that way, but by that hope to be brought in afterward, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.19.

                     <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> In his firſt way of abuſing the Law: <hi>He preacheth the Law unprofitably, not only that darkeneth it with obſcure queſtions, but that doth not teach Chriſt by it: and I ſee not but that Miniſters may be bumbled, that they have preſſed religious duties, but not ſo as to ſet up Chriſt: and hereby people have been content with Duties and Sacraments, though no Chriſt in them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. I dare appeal to any of your conſtant Hearers, or to the diligent Reader of this your Book, whether any (though you pretend the contrary) did more darken the Law with obſcure que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, and vain-jangling about it. 2. You are ſingular, that will have a Miniſter teach Chriſt by the Law: We may all come to your School to learn this new way. I muſe what a Chriſt the Law ſetteth forth; it is moſt like, you mean the ſetting up of Chriſt by preſſing religious duties, as your own, and next expreſſion is; which is a moſt ſtrange, yea and impoſſible way to any that knoweth, or ever received Chriſt truly. 3. I would take you in the beſt ſence, if I could yet make any good and ſound ſence of your words. Have you perceived indeed any ſuch failing in Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, that they may be humbled for preſſing dutyes, ſo as they have not ſet up Chriſt? Your Charge is heavy, on whomever it
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53450:15"/>lighteth: but you are ſo wiſe as to beware of putting your hand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Hornet's neſt, for fear they flie not alſo about your ears: ſave your skin, and meddle not too much with that <hi>Noli me tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere; If I preach Circumciſion, why do I yet ſuffer perſecution? then is the offence of the Croſſe ceaſed, Gal.</hi> 5.11. But you would have religious duties preſſed ſo as a Chriſt may be in them; what, and not a Chriſt without them, a naked Chriſt, But Chriſt inveſted and clothed with works, as Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> his complaint was to <hi>Queen Elizabeth?</hi> yea firſt a Chriſt, and then duties. Let the poor, ſinful, miſerable and loſt ſoul firſt be united and married to him, <hi>in whom dwelleth the fulneſs of the Godhead, and in whom ſhe is then compleat, wanting nothing, Col.</hi> 2.9, 10. then tell of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: The true Chriſt wil be all, or none; he will be alone, without the joyning or mixture of duty; as Chriſt hath ſatisfied the Father, ſo that in him he is well pleaſed: ſo are we to preach him and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable treaſures in him, that he alone may ſatisfie the Conſcience, give true reſt to the ſoul, be the way to favor, peace and life, and be the reaſon and ground of all reſpect and acceptance: thus a dejected and diſtreſſed ſoul may know and receive him aright, and finde ſure and everlaſting conſolation; and then may your duties and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances have their due place, ends and praiſe, with no danger. But if you can make all your duties of pure and meer Chriſt, you are a ſtrange Alchymiſt; this is ſuch Chymical Divinity, that I cannot skill of, nor well underſtand. Laſtly, You ſay, people have been contented with Duties and Sacraments, though no Chriſt in them, ſtill laying the blame of this upon the Miniſters. What I except a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt here, is, that your words import, the people ſhould have Chriſt in duties, as he is in Sacraments: which is dangerous, or at leaſt doubtful in the meaning. As duties do differ much from Sacraments (duties being our work; what is wrought in and by the Sacraments, is properly Gods Act) ſo Chriſt is ſo preſent in the Sacraments, that there he is repreſented, and exhibited: which I hope you will not affirm of your duties. You have many ſuch dark and difficult phraſes, which the ſimple by miſtaking may be miſlead.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> 5. <hi>When they do oppoſe it to Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Chriſt and the Law together, is to make oppoſition: there can no more be two Suns in the Firmament, then two things
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53450:15"/>to juſtifie; there the reconciliation of the Law and Chriſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be in matter of juſtification, by way of mixture.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> As the <hi>Iews</hi> error was to oppoſe the Law to Chriſt in juſtification, ſo it is your Error to oppoſe them in ſanctification: which you contend to be by the Law: Chriſt of God is made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, as Righteouſneſs, ſo Sanctification. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. 2. If their compoſition of Chriſt and Law was oppoſition; can your compounding of them be any other? yea you include Chriſt in the Law, which they never did. 3. As two things cannot juſtifie, ſo Chriſt and Law both cannot ſanctifie; therefore the reconciliation of Chriſt and the Law, cannot be neither in matter of Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by way of mixture.</p>
                     <p>M. <hi>B.</hi> In 8 way thus. <hi>And certainly for this twofold end, I may think God ſuffers this Antinomian Error to grow:</hi> 1. <hi>That Miniſters may humble themſelves, that they have not ſet forth Chriſt and grace, in all the glory of it— How much more may we ſay, that in many Sermons, in many mans Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, the drift and end of all his preaching is not, that Chriſt may be advanced?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Error is yours, who call light darkneſs. We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Chriſts Barn-ſloore;<note place="margin">Aliquis ſuit uſus in illo.</note> your looſe tongue is not the Fan to ſeperate, nor can all this boiſterous winde blow us away. The Doctrine is of God, (you had need take heed how you fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it) he hath planted it, and will defend and water it: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſhall take root, flouriſh and proſper; what you imagine or practiſe againſt it, is a vaine thing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.12. There is an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of Grace, who ſhall receive it, though others be blinded, and hardened; and for their ſakes God will have it preached, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread, maugre all malice and ſpite of man. And therefore Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters may be humbled, that they have ſo much doted upon the Law of works, that Chriſt, and the riches of his grace, hath been, like the chief Corner-ſtone, deſpiſed by the builders. It ſeemeth, you know many a mans Miniſtry guilty herein; and about twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years ago, there were fourty for one now: So hath God been pleaſed to cauſe the Sun of righteouſneſs to come from under the clouds. But be bold, and let them hear it again; they take you to be one of them, a fellow-worker, a friend: your reproof will be well taken, and digeſted, much rather now then heretofore.</p>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:53450:16"/>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> 2. <hi>Another end may be to have theſe truths beaten out more—the grace of juſtification, becauſe not only of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, but Antinomians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> And why becauſe of the <hi>Antinomians?</hi> For their ſakes doubtleſs it is, that the moſt acceptable Doctrine of free grace doth ſo gloriouſly ſhine forth: and alſo, if the world have any more inſight into that myſtical Article of Juſtification, by theſe labors of yours, or of others of this kind, thanks may be given to the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomians,</hi> as you ſtill call them. <hi>Some preach Chriſt, even of envy and ſtrife, and ſome alſo of good will: the one preach Chriſt of contention, not ſincerely, ſuppoſing to add affliction to my bonds: but the other of love,</hi> Philip. 1.15, 16.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>B. Luther ſpeaks in his Commentary on</hi> Geneſis, <hi>much againſt</hi> Antinomiſts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> But how unlike are your <hi>Antinomians</hi> to thoſe? even as you are to <hi>Luther.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>B. But yet, becauſe people are fallen into a formality of truths, it is good to ſet up Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Then if other truths were in power, you ſee no need nor would have any care to ſet up Chriſt. And what availe all other truths beſides Chriſt, who is all in all? The great Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to know among the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> not any thing, ſave Jeſus Chriſt, and him Crucified, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.2. All other learning will ſpoile us, if it be not after Chriſt, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.8. Is there any foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation but Chriſt? doth not all light, life, power, peace, conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, goodneſs, felicity, flow from Chriſt? What a god, or Idol ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, do you, or your people worſhip, draw nigh unto, know, put confidence in, out of Chriſt? All religion and performances be as a dead and ſtinking carcaſe, without faith in him. <hi>Paul</hi> counted all other things but loſſe and dung, for the excellency of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.8.</p>
                     <p>But give ear, you fellow-Miniſters, and profeſſors all, to what your Champion here ſaith. If Chriſt had been truly ſet up, ſuch falling into formality would have been prevented; and now no remedy againſt this grievous malady, but the advancing of him. Law, and preaching of works never ſo zealouſly, cannot effect the cure. And yet obſerve how in the cloſure, and firſt Uſe of this Lecture he ſaith, How uncharitably and falſely many men charge it generally up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53450:16"/>on our godly Miniſters, that they are nothing but juſticiaries and leagal-preachers! for do not all ſound and godly Miniſters hold forth this Chriſt, this righteouſneſs, this way of juſtification? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may not theſe things be heard in our Sermons daily? Now, Sir, compare that with this your own charge in this place; alſo, how then is it you ſo complain of formality, for which cauſe you would have Chriſt ſet up? how it is with you now, I know not; but let me add this, That where I have been, (and there was no want of outward profeſſion and zeal) your choice profeſſors <hi>(etiam The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologi)</hi> were ſo ignorant of juſtification, the righteouſneſs of faith and Chriſt, that they ſayd they never heard that Doctrine before. And being examined further, they replyed that their duties and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of God was their faith and way of peace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe were men of greateſt note, and long ſtanding; and ſeeing their error laid o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, their foundation ſandy, and their <hi>Babel</hi> like to fall, many of them began to oppoſe and perſecute; ſome are yet alive: And I continuing, through the good hand of God, in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> where I frequented their monthly Exerciſes at two places; yet did I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hear one Sermon of Chriſt or his righteouſneſs; nor no other way to peace and life, but to Reform and Conform, attending to the rule and precepts of the Law; and this was for about the ſpace of eight years.</p>

                     <p>Mr. <hi>B. While our Proteſtant Authors were diligent in dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out that pretious gold of juſtification by free-grace, out of the mine of the Scripture; ſee what Canons the Councel of</hi>
                        <pb n="16" facs="tcp:53450:17"/>Trent <hi>made againſt them, as</hi> Antinomian—<hi>You may gather by theſe their Canons, that we hold ſuch opinions, as indeed, the</hi> Antinomian <hi>doth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The like is our caſe now. For 1. As <hi>Luther</hi> ſeemed to have prophecyed truly of our times, when he ſaid, that after his dayes, the Doctrine of free-juſtification would be loſt again, (as we know it ſo came to paſs) and of late years, through the preaching and writing of ſome few, it hath been happily revived, and brought out of obſcurity to open and clear light again; yet what Cannons have been both made, and ſhot off againſt thoſe men? and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands ceaſe not ſtill to conſult how to extinguiſh, and ſuppreſs the ſame. And 2. of what other ſpirit can you judg your ſelves to be, then that Councel was led by, while you account the ſame Doctrine <hi>Antinomian,</hi> as they did, and alſo practiſe to your ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt againſt it? And yet, whereas you grant that you hold ſuch opinions-indeed, which they condemned, you confeſs your ſelf an <hi>Antinomian</hi> indeed, and cannot ſo clear your ſelf as your Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries do.</p>
                     <p>M. <hi>B. But our writers anſwer, Here they groſly miſtake us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> And if you do not, yet the world may plainly ſee how you miſtake and ſcandalize us. And ſo ignorant are the moſt of free-grace, and ſo legally principled, that where the Papiſts ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, there they are offended alſo.</p>
                     <p>M. <hi>B.</hi> In 2 S. <hi>Now if all this were ſpoken to take men off from that general ſecret ſin, of putting confidence in the good works we do, it were more tolerable.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> You love not the truth for it ſelf ſimply, but for ſome end that you like, it may be tolerable. 2. Yet if you hold and teach good works to be neceſſarie to ſalvation, yea in regard of preſence, and that the promiſe of life is made unto them, as you tell us, I ſee no how that ſin of confidence in them can be avoided. For as my ſoul thinketh any thing needful to ſave me, ſo far I will truſt, and lean to it. But the truth is, that Chriſt hath ſaved us: the work is finiſhed and done, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. And God ſendeth his Meſſengers, or Miniſters forth to call men in, that they may ſee the ſalvation of their God: know, all things are made ready; fit down, and reſt ſecurely, comfortably, and contentedly in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53450:17"/>and injoyment of it. Neither touching this matter, can you finde more high expreſſions in <hi>Luther,</hi> as you tearm them, then in the New Teſtament: ſee <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.4. <hi>All things are prepared.</hi> Luk. 2.30, 31. <hi>Mine eyes have ſeen thy ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which thou haſt prepared before the face of all people.</hi> Eph. 2.8, 9. <hi>He hath ſaved us: By grace ye are ſaved not by works, leſt any man ſhould boaſt.</hi> It is you, that are too low of Stature, who cannot reach to ſalvation by ſimple believing, and receiving it, unleſs you be heightened, and the hands of your faith be lengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by good works; and there is no fault in the highneſs of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion: I would learn of you how good works can be preſent, when a loſt ſinner layeth hold on ſalvation, or on Chriſt that he may be ſaved? or what the preſence of them can availe him? or what good work was required of the Jaylor or found in him when trembling (as truly wretched, and undone) and crying what he might do to be ſaved; <hi>Paul</hi> bade him to believe in the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and he ſhould be ſaved, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.31? but of this more hereafter, as occaſion will be given.</p>
                     <p>M. <hi>B.</hi> S 3. <hi>If this were their ground of many unſavoury aſſertions among them,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> If you were not too dainty nice, and quick in miſ-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion our aſſertions would not effend you; but be as ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury and acceptable as they be to others, of as good judgment as your ſelf.</p>
                     <p>M. <hi>B. That there may be injudiciouſneſs in them, as a cauſe in part of ſome their erroneous paſſages, will appear, in that they frequently ſpeak contradictions.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> If you have greater perfection in judgment and other parts, ſhame not, nor diſdain them that want; neither be arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant in your ſelf: you have nothing but what you received. 2. In the undertaking and managing of this quarrel, you bewray great weakneſs of judgment, as all may perceive. 3. If ſpeaking of contradictions do argue injudiciouſneſs, this is more then evident in you; I could give inſtance in many paſſages, which I obſerved. You condemn that aſſertion, It's no Law, if it have no power, as to command, ſo to curſe; and yet with the ſame breath do ſay, that a Law is alway condemning potentially, though not actually: If it be condemning potentially alway, then it hath alway power;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53450:18"/>do you not ſee your contradiction? If it do not actually, it is not becauſe <hi>lex non eſt damnaus,</hi> but for want of occaſion. And the like may be ſeen in your expreſſions about the Law, and ſalvation by grace, and by works, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ibid. <hi>This is a paſſage often, but very dangerous: That let a man be a wicked man, even as high as enmity it ſelf can make a man, yet while he is thus wicked, and while he is no better, his ſins are pardoned, and he juſtified: Yet in other paſſages, Though a man be never ſo wicked, yet if he come to Chriſt, if he will take Chriſt his ſins are pardoned. Now what a contradiction is here? To be wicked and while he is wicked, and while he is no better, and yet to take Chriſt; unleſs they hold, that to take Chriſt, or to come to him, be no good thing at all.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If you wanted not charity towards your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, you might have tolerated, and accounted of ſuch-like paſſages, as you do of thoſe high expreſſions in <hi>Luther;</hi> and you paſs by great mountains in Dr. <hi>Tayler,</hi> as if no error were in him, and are thus ſtrict to finde out a mole-hil or mote in Dr. <hi>Criſp;</hi> and yet can ſhew none. This is out of no love to truth, or hatred of error. 2. Many things, we ſay, are tolerated in <hi>Luther,</hi> for many ſpecial reaſons: and it is clear to me, that the ſame grounds of toleration were in this Author you ſo except againſt. 3. The injudiciouſneſs ſeemeth here to be in you, who ſee not to put a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between a wicked mans diſpoſition, and his condition while he is thus wicked, and no better; to wit, in his ſtate and condition. If he will come to Chriſt, take Chriſt, that argueth a change in diſpoſition and will, a minde to be delivered and freed from that ſo curſed and dangerous condition he is in. 4. To come to Chriſt, to take Chriſt, be good for the wicked man; for he hath no way elſe left for ſalvation; but firſt he may thank him, from whom that motion and perſwaſion came, who gave him that heart and ability to come. <hi>None can come to me, unleſs the Father draw him, Ioh.</hi> 6.45. And 2. If this be all the good you ſo plead for to come to Chriſt, then he is wicked, and no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor otherwiſe till he come, or begin, and have a heart to come; and ſo much his words import; which might have prevented this wrangling, if you pleaſed. 5. Will you teach a man, that this
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53450:18"/>act of comming or taking Chriſt, is a good thing in him, to be looked at by him? or that it is any whit ſatisfactory to the juſtice of the Law, or available to the recovery of his loſt ſoul and eſtate? that he may put this act in, and reckon it towards his diſcharge, or juſtification? or you will teach and tell him that Chriſt is all this, unto whom he therefore cometh forthat purpoſe. If a notorious Malefactor, condemned to dye, have a pardon put into his hands, or have it for going to the King; can he plead his going? or doth any account him leſs wicked, or guilty for that?</p>
                     <p>Alſo, In the ſame page 30. and Sect. <hi>you are offended with the Authors Rhetorical expreſſions, as is alſo Mr.</hi> Geree.</p>
                     <p>

Let Chriſt be the way, and good works our imployment or buſineſs in the way, as he ſaith, and then I ſee no error nor danger. If you do truly good works, you do them in Chriſt, <hi>abiding in him, Ioh.</hi> 15.4. in whom you are alive, and walk continually by faith: doth the ſoul go out of Chriſt, or leave him, when or while it worketh? <hi>As ye have received Chriſt Jeſus, ſo walk in him, Coloſ.</hi> 2.6. Now the ſoul cannot walk in Chriſt, nor have union with him, ſave by faith: the believer alſo walketh in the way of the Law of works, but this is his way on earth amongſt men, and Chriſt is his way to God and heaven. Let me add: Chriſt is ſet forth ſo to be our way, that he is our ſalvation alſo; ſo that in him the ſoul is at her journies end, and need not work to go further for attaining life, as if it were a far off, and good works were a way to carry and bring us unto it. Eternal life is in the Sonne; <hi>He that hath the Sonne, hath eternal life alſo,</hi> Joh. 3.36. 1 Joh. 5.11, 12. Alſo the words of <hi>Bernard</hi> are, <hi>Viaregni,</hi> not <hi>ad regnum:</hi> of which difference, ſee more in the <hi>Aſſertion of Grace.</hi>

There is a broad way common to the religious <hi>Iews,</hi> Papiſts, and deceived Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, which leadeth to deſtruction. As for the way of downright wickedneſs, all know that is the way to hell. And as many in a blinde zeal are carried to damnation, as by prophaneſs and actual outward ſinning. And this is a ſtrong inducement to me, thus to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it, as, that to believe, is the ſtraighteſt way of all others, and feweſt finde and walk in that way with an upright foot; ſo becauſe Chriſt is there ſpeaking of Teachers and their Doctrine, and not of mans life and manners: ſo that it is doctrine he meaneth to be the ſtraight way, for it is doctrine, true or falſe, that guideth and carrieth the ſoul one way or other, to heaven or hell: and that is either the righteouſneſs of faith, or the righteouſneſs of works. <hi>He that believeth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved: he that believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, ſhall be damned:</hi> and no good work can help to ſave him.</p>

And this is to you ſo dangerous, that to your charity it is inexcuſable; yet your great reading might tell you of divers Orthodox, who ſpeak and write as much, and the Scripture will warant the ſame, when you come profeſſedly to handle the point hereafter.

But this I am bold to ſay, that this is not that Law or Doctrine which came firſt out of Gods Sion, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2. If you teach thus, then no man can dare to beleive or receive remiſſion of ſins through Chriſts blood, till he be ſure he finde firſt the preſence of good works: and when will that be, that a man can finde good works before he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve? or what are the good works he muſt ſo neceſſarily finde, and unto which the pardon is promiſed? you might have done wiſely, and it had been a ſpecial work of charity, to have given inſtance in ſome; and then to have ſhewed both how thoſe good works may be done in the ſtate of unbelief, and alſo how they may be certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known to be good before faith. O poor, ſinful and trembling ſoul! into what an inextricable labyrinth will this bring thee! and when thou ſhalt be deeply plunged into temptation, how to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent thy fearful deſperation, by this doctrine, is utterly impoſſible. 2. By this you will make people look more to good works, then to Chriſt preſent and formed in the heart <hi>the</hi> only <hi>hope of glory, Col.</hi> 1.27. And <hi>he that hath Chriſt hath life, and he that hath not the Son hath not life,</hi> whatever works he may pretend to have, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.12. 3. Yea a legal Miniſtery exhorting to duties, performances, and conformity to the Law of works, will be held ſufficient, and men need not be bid to examine themſelves, <hi>whether they be in the faith, and Chriſt dwell in them,</hi> or no, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. but whether they have ſtore of good works, and ſo they may be ſure of pardon, and ſalvation. But, Sir, If you will have your Doctrine to have a free paſſage, why do you not prove, clear, and confirm it? your word will not bear and warrant a Tenet of this weighty importance, and conſequence. Where finde you God ſpeaking to the work, or not rather to the worker? and if the promiſe be made alſo to him of pardon or life, it is for his faith, or rather for Chriſts ſake, <hi>in whom all the promiſes are yea and Amon, unto the glory of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.20.

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53450:22"/>On that ever ſuch a Doctrine ſhould ſee the Sun, be heard out of any our Pulpits, and be ſuffered to paſs the Preſs, and with ſuch applauſe to be publiſhed. That good works muſt neceſſarily be preſent when we be juſtified: and God ſhould ſo reſpect and love them that he promiſeth pardon and eternal life to them or to their preſence! you mean ſure to the man for their preſence ſake; for if they be ſo good and holy,<note place="margin">Etiam bona o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pera egent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſione.</note> they need no pardon: or if they were not firſt pardoned, by what art become they good?

That phraſe of Gods laying of ſin upon the juſtified in any reſpect, is no Scripture-phraſe, but it is full of danger, and moſt agreeable to the principles of reaſon, a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conſcience, and the Law. 3. How bitter ſin is, may beſt be ſeen, when we ſee and conſider it upon Chriſt who under the heavy weight of it ſweating water and blood, cryed ſo out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> I grant the afflicted conſcience knoweth ſome little of it: and if ever God lay ſin upon you, and let you not ſee it laid on Chriſt for your full and final diſcharge, it will then be intolerable.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> 4. <hi>In denying them to be ſignes or teſtimonies of grace, or Chriſt dwelling in us. And here one would wonder to ſee how laborious an Author is to prove that no inherent grace can be ſigns,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. They can be made no further evidences, then it is evident and plain that they ariſe from true faith; and then I muſt firſt know that I have faith, and be aſſured I am juſtified, elſe all
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53450:22"/>ſuch ſigns will leave me uncertain, and may prove to be counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits. For, as this Argument holdeth not, <hi>Here is light, therefore the Sun is up:</hi> for all light is not from the Sun; the Moon, and the Candle have proper lights alſo: ſo all that we call graces, and holy duties, come not from faith, nor are not only found to be in him, who is in a juſtified eſtate, and therefore cannot convincing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly argue ſuch an eſtate. VVhat can you inſtance in being material<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good, that was not in <hi>Paul</hi> while he was a <hi>Phariſee;</hi> who was <hi>blameleſs, as touching the Law?</hi> I fear me, that it contenteth us, that we know, teach and profeſs a Chriſt crucified, and come not to finde Chriſt truly formed and dwelling in the heart; whoſe preſence is the only light, peace, conſolation, and reſt to the Soul: and that is the reaſon of our eying and requiring of works and graces, for teſtimonies and aſſurances of a good eſtate.</p>
                     <p>M. <hi>B.</hi> In anſwering the Author, <hi>We may ſhew briefly how many weak props this diſcourſe leaneth upon.</hi> 1. <hi>In confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the inſtrumental evidencing with the efficient: Not holy works, ſay they, but the Spirit. How he doth oppoſe ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Spirit and works are not ſubordinate: for, as is ſhewed, works may be, where the Spirit of adoption and faith is not. 2. Neither can they be ſubordinate, except the Spirit do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly reveal and confirm a good eſtate by them: which you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make good.</p>
                     <p>Again, you ſay, <hi>Every man is in darkneſs, and like</hi> Hagar <hi>ſeeth not a fountain, till his eyes be opened.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> That is true: but where do you read that our duties, or works, do open the eyes, and clear this unto us? The opening of the eyes is a good work indeed: but it is Gods work and not ours, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.17.</p>
                     <p>M. <hi>B. We ſay, that a Chriſtian in time of darkneſs and temptation, is not to go by ſigns,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> And out of darkneſs and temptation, what need is there to put them to that uſe? will you light a candle at noon-day, when there is light enough? 2. when there is no temptation occaſioning the queſtioning of faith, or the eſtate, what need is there to prove either?</p>
                     <p>M. <hi>B.</hi> 3. His arguments go upon falſe grounds. 1. <hi>That a
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53450:23"/>man cannot diſtinguiſh himſelf from hypocrites.</hi> 2. <hi>That there can be no aſſurance, but upon a full and compleat work of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. No; A man cannot diſtinguiſt, himſelf certainly, without faith's evidence: how would you have diſcovered <hi>Paul,</hi> having a zealous reſpect to all Gods Commandments? 2. No one, nor all your works can bring aſſurance ſufficient: I dare ſay, that ſoul, which ſeeketh eſtabliſhment, and to overcome doubting that way, is far from it in the ſecret bottom of it: Imperfections in all, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the conſcience is privie, will more weaken, then confirm: <hi>Semper operum reſpect neſt trepidandi materia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>M. <hi>B.</hi> 4. <hi>All thoſe Arguments will hold as ſtrongly againſt faith: for, are there not many believers for a ſeaſon or may not a man then know aſſoon the nature of his heart, as the truth of his faith?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Though true faith fail never, yet that is not ſimply from the nature of faith, for there is no gift of grace, but of it ſelf it is periſhable: Conſtancy and immutability natural be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proper to God, therefore Chriſt prayed that <hi>Peters</hi> faith might not fail. 2. Faith doth not aſcertain, in that it indureth, but in that by it the ſoul hath an effectual entrance into that grace where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it ſtandeth irremoveably, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.2. 3. There is not that light of evidence in ſincerity, which is in faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. faith giveth light to thoſe things which otherwiſe cannot lightly be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>
                     <p>M. <hi>B. Now let us conſider their grounds for this ſtrange aſſertion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> I cannot ſay what aſſertion you mean: but it is not much material.</p>
                     <p>M. <hi>B. Becauſe,</hi> Rom. 4. <hi>It is ſaid,</hi> God juſtifieth the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly. <hi>Now this hath a twofold Anſwer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>That which our Divines do commonly give, that thoſe works are not to be underſtood</hi> in ſenſu compoſito, <hi>&amp;c. therefore they compare theſe paſſages with thoſe of making the blinde to ſee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>not that they did ſee while they were blinde, but thoſe who were blinde do now ſee: and this is true and good.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> If you grant, that a man is as meerly ungodly till he be
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53450:23"/>juſtified, as a man is blinde till his eyes be opened, with thoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, the Doctor and you might agree; but this anſwer likes you not, though you ſay it is good and true, ſo well as another, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> 2. <hi>But I ſhall ſecondly anſwer it,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly there, is meant of ſuch who are ſo, in their nature conſidered, having not an abſolute righteouſneſs, yet at the ſame time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, even as Abraham was. — So then the ſubject of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification is a ſinner, yet a believer. Now it is impoſſible. that a man ſhould be a believer, and his heart not purified</hi> Act 15.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> So that in few and plain words, your opinion is, as we ſee by this and other paſſages, where you call <hi>Abraham</hi> the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly man, <hi>That a man muſt be a believer have his heart pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by faith be qualified as</hi> Abraham <hi>was at leaſt then, when it was ſaid, his faith was imputed for righteouſneſs, before he can be capable of juſtification;</hi> here is poor and cold comfort to a diſtreſſed conſcience, who feels himſelf nothing but a meer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound of ſin and miſery. Do you put men to believe, and to know they believe, and to be ſure faith hath purified the heart (but you mean not faith neither but the Law) and ſanctified them, before they come to God who juſtifieth the ungodly? A profound Rabbi: O ſtrange Divinity! much good do it you. You fear infection, and ſo get as far from Doctor <hi>Criſp.</hi> and from <hi>Paul's</hi> Doctrine as may be; yet truth is with you, Your <hi>Comes indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duus:</hi> to part at and you is impoſſible. You might have named ſome of thoſe learned men, for I know them not. But to deal pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually, 1. You know, that Doctor <hi>Criſp</hi> ſpeaks of juſtification, as it is Gods only free act, abſolving and diſcharging all the Elect of all their ſins at once, even then when he laid them on Chriſt. Now as God ſaid to <hi>Job, Where waſt thou when I caſt the mountains?</hi> ſo where was this Faith, purity of heart, and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication then? this is no evaſion you know; but by this all you have ſaid is annihilated; he makes faith not to be neceſſary to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, but the evidence of it in due time for the relieving ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and comforting of the conſcience troubled and affected by ſin and the Law. 2. To draw nearer to you, who have thus ſet your ſelf at this great diſtance, that your longeſt weapon cannot teach your Adverſary to harm him; I will grant you, that the Scripture ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53450:24"/>forth God as a juſtifier of them that are of the faith of Jeſus, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.26. but let me then aske whether it be his faith, or Gods act in juſtifying, that doth alter him and his condition? Iſrael looked upon the Brazen Serpent, but the bleſſing of health came from God which did effect the cure. 2. You ſay <hi>faith purified the heart,</hi> Act. 15. what before juſtification, or after? <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Luther</hi> underſtand that purifying to be by juſtification. <hi>Luthers</hi> words are, <hi>Totus purus es, ratione hoſpitis tui:</hi> becauſe of Chriſt received by faith, the heart becometh pure. And when you tell us, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> is that ungodly man, if you mean he was ungodly when he was juſtified, there is no difference; But if you conſider him other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, he was then a worker, and ſo the text is fully againſt you. <hi>To him that worketh not,</hi> &amp;c. But when <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>He believed in God who juſtifieth the ungodly,</hi> it is a deſcription of the object of faith, or of God on whom faith believeth, even that God whoſe nature, property, office and promiſe is to juſtifie an ungodly man; and not a declaration how the ſubject, or man is to be qualified. So that the true God of the Goſpell findeth men ungodly when he juſtifieth them; but leaveth them not ſo. Or, if you will underſtand the place of <hi>Abraham,</hi> (yet there is no cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance requiring it) how ever he was ſo qualified by faith, his heart purified, he reported and found to have exellent things in him, at that time when it was ſaid, his faith was imputed for righeouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.5. yet God in whom he believed, is ſaid to juſtifie them that are without ſuch qualifications, even the ungodly.</p>
                     <p>M. <hi>B. Another place they much ſtand upon, is</hi> Rom. 5. Chriſt died for us while we were enemies, while we were ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. But, <hi>why then do they ſay, that if a man be as great an enemy as enmity it ſelf can make him, if he be willing to take Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>be ſhall be pardoned? (which we ſay is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, for how can an enemy with Chriſt, cloſe with Chriſt?) So that would ſeem more then in ſome places they ſeem to allowe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> You doe not ſurely deny the truth of that Scripture, but argue the inconſiſtency of it with that aſſertion, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſuch great enemies and ſinners cloſing with Chriſt, can be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned: this is a Contradiction, ſay you. I anſwer, 1. If Chriſt died not for ſuch, how could ſuch come unto him or believe on him?
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53450:24"/>So that there is a ſweet harmony; yea who elſe could be ſaved? for what difference is there originally, and inwardly? (though not in outward expreſſions and out-breakings to the eye of the world) the ſtricteſt Phariſee is as wicked and unclean as the looſeſt Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine: God looketh upon the heart. But 2. you ask <hi>how can an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to Chriſt, cloſe with Chriſt?</hi> I anſwer, Is it not poſſible for enemies to be reconciled? or for a Rebell convinced of his danger to ſubmit and receive a gracious pardon being offered? and when he is receiving it, he may rightly and worthily be called a Rebell, though afterward he become a true profeſſed Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. 3. Neither the Text alledged, nor the Doctor, ſay enemies to Chriſt, but when we were enemies, <hi>viz.</hi> to God, his juſtice and holineſs, in reference to his law. For as God abſolutely conſidered cannot be the object of mans hatred, ſo God in Chriſt as Mediatour cometh under another Notion, as being the onely meanes to ſlay enmity, and reconcile both in himſelf. You ſay it is more then in ſome places they allow. <hi>Anſ.</hi> When you ſhew ſome place, we may ſpeak to it. But how frequently read you in Doctor <hi>Criſp,</hi> theſe and like expreſſions? If God give thee an heart to come, if thou canſt believe, if now thou have a mind to cloſe with Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which ought to have prevented all theſe exceptions, as annulling the grounds and reaſons of them: I marvell that any underſtanding and experienced man ſhould except againſt his Miniſtery it tending ſpecially to encourage the poore and troubled ſoul to come freely and with confidence unto Chriſt: aſſuring it, there is no ſuch force and let as the conſcience of ſin and his own unworthineſs will ſuggeſt. Oh how hard a thing is it in the feeling and horrour of ſin to look up to free-grace, and to receive Chriſt the gift of God, without all diſputings and reaſonings about workes, or qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? It is an evill rooted deeply in nature, even that opinion, which your doctrine maintaineth, nouriſheth and ſtrengtheneth; enough to overthrow the ſoul in the hour of tentation; witneſs all experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And ſo the thought and conſideration of ſome conceited goodneſs doth breed preſumption, and an unwarrantable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of being the rather accepted. If the Doctor had ſaid that Chriſt is theirs, and become their ſalvation, whenas yet they had no heart to receiue, or deſire him, you had ſome ground of excepting againſt him.</p>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:53450:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <p>M. <hi>B. Chriſt dyed not onely to juſtifie, but to ſave us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Chriſt hath ſaved all that are to be ſaved, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. 2. But it followeth not therefore, that any can lay hold on ſalvation without juſtification or the righteouſneſs of faith (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he may ſo do without the righteouſneſs of works, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5.) for juſtification is to life, the Antecedent of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18.</p>
                     <p>M. <hi>B. Indeed the grand principle, that Chriſt hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed and obtained antecedently to us in their ſenſe, will as neceſſarily infer that a drunkard abiding a drunkard, ſhall be ſaved as well as juſtified.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> That Chriſt hath purchaſed and obtained all graces (as you call them) is ſo clear and fully convincing in the light of the Scripture, that you cannot deny the truth of it, onely our ſenſe of it is corrupt and erroneous, as you ſay; but why do you not tell what our ſenſe is? It is out of no love, that you conceal it: but rather it argueth a minde in you to make the world thinke worſe of us then you can make us to appear. What you make, or how you pervert our ſenſe, would be ſeen; but that grand princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will neceſſarily infer the contrary to the concluſion you make: for what Chriſt purchaſed for us, muſt neceſſarily be diſpenſed and given; therefore cannot that grace of Regeneration be withheld from them that are Chriſts: but it cometh to them not in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive way of the Law, but through the word of promiſe, which you cannot skill of. If any ſhould teach that ſome graces, favour, and part of eternal life were left to be purchaſed and obtained by our obedience and ſervice, that doctrine might finde more free paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, and better entertainment. But I wonder you are ſo peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and unadviſed in making ſuch an inference, as if juſtification did leave a man as it found him, and there were no vertue, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy, nor health in it, nor that pretious faith apprehending it: or as if we did teach ſo (as by you we are ſlandered) the contrary ſtill lying under your eyes. You need, and muſt be forced to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that <hi>Tot us proceſſus,</hi> &amp;c. the only and whole paſſage from ſin to righteouſneſs, from death to life, from bondage under wrath, and the curſe, unto liberty, and the receiving into favour, and felicity, is attributed by Scripture, and all ſound Divines to that article of free juſtification: ſo that in true and ſtrict ſenſe, ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53450:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>is inſeparable from it. Yet that the world may ſee, how the ſimple intent and ſenſe of Dr. <hi>Criſp</hi> is miſrepreſented by you, theſe are his words, <hi>pag.</hi> 66. <hi>Chriſt the only way; If a man,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>have a little holineſs and righteouſneſs, he thinks now that in regard of that he may without preſumption cloſe with Chriſt. Chriſt came not to call the righteous, but ſinners; but it ſeems a man muſt be righteous before he have to do with the calling of Chriſt.</hi> See now whether this be with, or againſt the Goſpel-free-grace; therefore even to ſinners is it no licentious doctrine, nor doth it a jot maintaine the continuance in ſin. I ſay therefore, that Chriſt doth belong to a perſon that cloſeth with him, though he be in his ſinfulneſs; Chriſt indeed doth waſh, cleanſe and adorn a perſon, when he is cloſed with, but there is none clean till Chriſt himſelf do enter, who makes clean where he doth enter. Do not then ſo miſconſtrue the Doctor, as if his doctrine were inconſiſtent with the truth. All that you can gather and directly conclude from him, is, that ſinners, under that very notion and name, are called upon in the Goſpel, to come unto Chriſt, that he is tendered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them while they are ſuch. If God give a heart to a wicked man at this inſtant willingly to cloſe with Chriſt, he giveth him an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, and compleat, and perfect intereſt in Chriſt: And theſe his expreſſions imply as much, as you in truth can require. For can there be a heart given to come, a real willingneſs to cloſe with Chriſt, where there is no ſight and ſenſe of ſin and danger? why doth the ſoul deſire Chriſt, believe in him? is it not that it may be ſaved from ſin, wrath and damnation, and obtain righteouſneſs, life, favor and ſalvation? doth not the haſtening unto the City of refuge, ſufficiently prove the man to be a manſlayer? ſo here, it argueth a true inward conviction of, and a real confeſſion of a guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty eſtate: yea, a perſwaſion that in Chriſt a diſtreſſed and purſued ſoul may be ſafe and in peace, but nowhere elſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>M. B. Now theſe ſpeak of Chriſts death, as an univerſal meritorious cauſe, without any application of Chriſts death un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this or that ſoul. Therefore you muſt ſtill carry this along with you, that to that grand mercy of juſtification ſomthing is requiſite as the efficient,</hi> viz. <hi>the grace of God; ſomething me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious,</hi> viz. <hi>Chriſts ſufferings; ſomething inſtrumental,</hi> viz. <hi>faith: and one is as neceſſary as the other.</hi>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The full bent, and chief drift of the Doctors miniſtery is the application of Chriſt, and the benefits of his death unto the ſoul, who ſo ſee any thing cannot but ſo judge. I marvel then at this your ſo palpable accuſation. 2. Dr. <hi>Criſp</hi> ſpeaketh of juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, as it is Gods alone gracious act in Chriſt, diſcharging and acquitting all the Elect in him at the time of his paſſion and reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection fully and for ever: This was done in <hi>fore caeli,</hi> or as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>coram judicio Dei.</hi> As for the inſtrumentals whether the word to reveal and publiſh it, or faith to apprehend and reſt on it, they were neither neceſſary to that Act of God: but onely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward to give evidence and aſſurance to the ſeveral conſciences of all thoſe Elect, of what was done for them freely by God in Chriſt upon the croſs; <hi>For there God was in Chriſt, reconciling them to himſelf,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.18.</p>
                     <p>M. <hi>B. I will but mention one place more,</hi> Pſal. 68.18. <hi>Thou haſt received gifts even for the rebellious alſo</hi> &amp;c. adding. <hi>Is not all this ſtrange? Though the Author preſs ſanctification never much in other places, yet certainly ſuch principles as theſe over grow it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Why is it that you think this ſtrange, <hi>viz. That the loathſomneſs and hatefulneſs of this rebellion, is tranſacted from the perſon upon the back of Chriſt?</hi> he beareth the ſin as well as the ſhame, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that God acquitted his Elect and ſatif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied his juſtice in Chriſt their Sure y; and by this means it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to paſs that God can dwell withthoſe perſons. Is this any more, then what <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in ſhort and plain words, <hi>viz. Chriſt was made ſin for us, who knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21. and Epheſ. 2.14. <hi>Chriſt by his Croſſe hath ſlain enmity, and made peace.</hi> Is not Chriſt the <hi>Communis terminus,</hi> the bond and mean of union and atonement with God by his only ſacrifice? while we were ſinners, enemies in our ſelves we were reconciled in Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10.</p>
                     <p>The ground and reaſon of your oppoſing is, in that you are of opinion that God commeth unto us by or with, or becauſe of ſome inherent graces or qualifications in us, which be as a <hi>Load-ſtone</hi> to draw and unite his affection; and that Chriſt is but the meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cauſe of this; a Papiſtical conceit.

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> If they tell you of ſuch perfection, that God ſeeth no ſin, they withal in the ſame place tell you (if you had the ſame ears to hear it) that this juſtification or Saintſhip is by imputation and not by inherent ſanctification: If Chriſt be held forth unto you by God himſelf, as one that hath waſhed you and cleanſed you from all ſin, and withal it be given you ſo to apprehend and receive it; what think you now of your ſelf and condition, while you abide in this light? In the Creed you ſay, <hi>I believe a holy Church,</hi> yet the Church it ſelf is no exterior or viſible thing, that the world can diſcern, though the perſons be viſible; and her holineſs is inviſible: onely faith, (<hi>which is of things not ſeen.</hi> Heb. 11.11.) can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold this purity of the Church, not in the Law, nor any work or inherent thing; but as ſhe is waſhed and made clean in the blood and righteouſneſs of her Redeemer. <hi>The Church is all fair,</hi> ſaith <hi>Auguſt. for her filthineſs is taken away by Chriſt and he hath made her fair.</hi> Look upon the Chriſtians life, and there thou maiſt finde many things that thou blameſt. If he look within himſelf, the work of renovation there wrought, it is alſo imperfect, and not pure; but as he is beheld in Chriſt who hath ſanctified him, he is altogether pure and holy: but faith only ſeeth this. Mark but this one ſaying of <hi>Calvin, To the intent that God may no more be an enemy, and take part againſt us who are ſinners, he muſt be fain to look upon us in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; you like to ſet the Law as a medium between God and you, which preſenteth you with ſin and wrath,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And why do, if not your ſelf yet many others in their prayers, ſay, <hi>Lord behold us not in our ſelves, but in our Lord Jeſus,</hi> &amp;c. If there be no ſuch pure and ſecure eſtate, why pray we to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to it? and if we be perſwaded of the truth of it, why wrangle we againſt it? you might inform your ſelf, and others, 1. what it
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53450:27"/>is to continue of your ſelves ſeparated or remote from Chriſt: and 2. of the meaning of the phraſe, <hi>God ſeeth no ſin;</hi> you reſerve this till afterward: ſo do I: and withal, for more full ſatisfaction, I refer the <hi>hony-combe of free juſtification, and the Aſſertion of grace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>M. <hi>B. ſer.</hi> 3. <hi>You ſhall carefully diſtinguiſh between theſe two propoſitions; good works are neceſſary to beleivers to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied perſons, or to thoſe that ſhall be ſaved:</hi> and this, <hi>good work's are neceſſary to juſtification and ſalvation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> It's too evident that your ſelf do not heedfully obſerve this diſtinction: Beſides, your ſenſe in the tearms you uſe, is doubtful when you ſay <hi>good works are neceſſary to juſtified perſons.</hi> Is it your meaning, after juſtification, according to that of <hi>Auguſtine, Nulla ſunt bona opera, niſi quae ſequuntur, precedente fide.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 67.</note> 
                        <hi>no works are good, except they follow faith, going before?</hi> or that they are neceſſarily required in order to go before, ſo that their preſence muſt be had neceſſarily when God juſtifieth; as your pleading hath been heitherto? I know the tearms or words them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are plain and diſtinct, but you confound them in your after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſecution.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. There be many kinds of neceſſary: And if you underſtand them to be neceſſary after juſtification in a right ſenſe you have no adverſary. But if good works be neceſſary to thoſe that ſhall be ſaved. I would ask you what you mean: for do you not hold ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be the proper, next, and immediate effect or conſequence of juſtification? can a man be ſaid, or ſuppoſed to be juſtified, and not to be ſaved? if he be juſtified, he hath Chriſt: he that hath Chriſt hath eternal life, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. <hi>ult.</hi> the eſſence of eternal life or ſalvation is but one, and indiviſible. You cannot make the full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation or ſeaſible fruition of it, to be any part of it: your error is, that you will have good works, neceſſary to come in between juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and ſalvation at leaſt, as a cauſe, <hi>ſine qua non</hi> or conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it: or ſo requiſite, that the promiſe of eternal life is made to them: and only by vertue of that their promiſe, eternal life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes his that doth the works. <hi>But eternal life is the free gift of God,</hi> Rom. 6.23. <hi>And ſalvation is in Chriſt alone,</hi> Act. 4.12. Ioh. 5.12. <hi>He that hath Chriſt, hath life;</hi> and if he have not Chriſt, he can have no life, whatſoever works he have. So that
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53450:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>as a man may have Chriſt without works by faith, ſo may he have ſalvation in order before good works; unleſs you will ſay, either that without Chriſt a man can do good works, or that Chriſt may be nad as ſeparate and a part from life and ſalvation: Chriſt and ſalvation ſtanding at a diſtance &amp; ſo after he be come unto Chriſt, and have him he muſt do good works that by them he may come unto it: but both theſe are impoſſible. Works done in this ſenſe, with ſuch a minde, and for ſuch an end as to help us to ſalvation, as if Chriſt did not ſufficiently content us, theſe works, ſaith <hi>Luther,</hi> cannot be good: but, whatever they be for the matter of them are and ought to be numbered among the worſt of evil works; forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, ſtealing, lying <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not ſo hanious ſaith he, neither is the danger and fearful effects and fruits of theſe evils comparable to the evil of ſuch pretended good works. While I do good to help me to ſalvation, I in heart deny Chriſt to be my full and ſufficient Saviour: I make faith void, and the promiſe to be of no effect; I overthrow the whole Goſpel of ſalvation, I appropriate the promiſe of life, not to Chriſt, nor ſaith, but to my works. And if it be ſaid, it is onely the preſence of good works that is accounted neceſſary to thoſe that ſhall be ſaved;</p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> You tell of an ordinability of works, and ſay that evil works cannot be ordained to eternal life, but good may: a very dark expreſſion: who ever read of ordination of works to heaven or hell, but of the worker? and ſecondly, there can be no ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in good works, nor by them to life, unleſs you can make it to appear, that God hath any reſpect unto them, either in ordaining or accepting us unto eternal life: but in this caſe, good works and grace are made directly oppoſite, and contrary one to the other; <hi>If by grace,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>not by works.</hi> Rom. 11.6. the ſoul is become or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinable by free grace, but not diſpoſed by works.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In your firſt Scripture, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.9. There is mention made of no work, but only of <hi>confeſſion of ſin:</hi> And is that ſuch a good work? <hi>Judas</hi> confeſſed that he had ſinned. If there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ordinability in it, it is not becauſe of any goodneſs in the act of confeſſion ſimply, but becauſe God hath purpoſed and promiſed, in that way, or after that order to diſpence and give his pardon; and ſo this place maketh directly againſt you, for it is by the knowledg and confeſſion of ſin, and not by any good thing the ſoule findeth or acknowledgeth in it ſelf, that its ordinability is effected. And whereas you obſerve, <hi>that God is not only faithful, but juſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to forgive;</hi> they are arguments to porſwade a man to take that
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53450:30"/>courſe without fear, or doubt; for man naturally hath that opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God, that where he ſheweth favor unto any, it is for ſome goodneſs; and therefore he dare not come as a naked and meer ſinner into Gods ſight and preſence, as is plain in <hi>Adam,</hi> Gen. 3. But if he can bring nothing elſe, he will make promiſe of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in ſome hope of mercy to be the rather ſhewed him: hence to correct, and ſatisfie our thoughts, and to encourage us to take this courſe, to come as we are in our ſins, making our ſelves, nor our caſe or matter better then it is, he requireth a free and ſimple confeſſion of ſins; adding, that God is faithful in his promiſe, in which he hath declared a gracious minde to pardon ſuch in his Son: and alſo, that his juſtice, the thought whereof in that caſe, chiefly terrifieth, is ſo fully ſatisfied, that now, <hi>non obſtante imò ſalva ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitiae,</hi> God may in order of his juſtice forgive and ſave.</p>
                     <p>To that other place, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. I have before ſhewed how you miſinterpret it: for that righteouſneſs unto which the crown be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth, is the righteouſneſs of God, and not ours, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. of faith, and not of works that we have done, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.22.</p>
                     <p>M. B. Hence ſome Divines ſay, that, <hi>though godlineſs be not meritorious, nor cauſal of ſalvation, yet it may be a motive: as they inſtance; if a King ſhould give great preferment to one that ſhould ſalute him in a morning, this ſalutation were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meritorious nor cauſal of that preferment, but a meer mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ariſing from the good pleaſure of the King; and ſo much they think that particle,</hi> for I was an hungry, <hi>doth imply.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> O how welcome and pleaſing is this teaching to mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture! It tendeth to withdraw our eyes and conſiderations from off Chriſt unto our ſelves, and from free-grace unto our works; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto all are moſt prone by nature. If our goodneſs be a motive moving God, 1. Then God ſeeth ſomething, out of himſelf exciting and moving him to do good: and if you hold this foreſight of goodneſs which thus moved him, was from eternity, you are not far from <hi>Arminianiſme</hi> or Popery; and if he was moved at the time of doing good (which many of them alſo hold) as the King you inſtance in, then this new and preſent motion in God to do good, is a child of time, begot in his minde or occaſioned of late: and God ſhoweth more kindneſs then from the beginning he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53450:30"/>Laſtly, a motive muſt needs have ſome influence, if not into the act of ſalvation, yet into the minde of God: for the ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation worketh upon the kinde nature and heart of the King, ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him up to be ſo bountiful; and the man may thank his ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in great part for his preferment. O happy man I, and happy was that time that I met and ſo ſaluted the King! but the Goſpel calleth from all ſuch fleſhly rejoycing in our ſelves, that he that rejoyceth may onely ſo do in the Lord Chriſt, in whom, and for whoſe ſake onely, God ſheweth all favour, exalteth and bleſſeth with all ſpiritual bleſſings. And why do you bring in and propound this to your hearers, and the whole world as now, but both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you like and approve of it, and would put all upon the like courſe and practiſe in hope ſo to ſpeed? But before they had done good or evil, it was ſaid, <hi>Jacob have I loved,</hi> &amp;c. The true God loveth, accepteth, and ſaveth freely in Chriſt, without any thing conſidered in the party.</p>
                     <p>M. <hi>B. So that God having appointed holineſs the way, and ſalvation the end; hence there ariſeth a relation between one and the other.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Keep the Law and Works, as you told us <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid, here below on the earth; and by faith mount up, live, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe above in heaven; then the way in which the ſoul walketh to ſalvation, is Chriſt and his righteouſneſs; a way ſanctified by his blood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19, 20. <hi>Believe and be ſaved:</hi> and ſo the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be between ſalvation and Chriſts righteouſneſs, and not our righteouſneſs of works: diſtinguiſh between believing <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and working <hi>Abraham,</hi> as <hi>Luther</hi> wiſely, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, For that place, <hi>I was an hungry,</hi> it makes nothing for your purpoſe: For. 1. The kindome was prepared from the foundation of the world, therefore God was not moved by works, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.34. 2. It is an argument from the effect of true faith working by love; by which faith they being accepted to life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, did declare and witneſs the truth of it, by ſuch ſeaſonable, proper, and kindely fruits as is there mentioned, all relating to Chriſt, and being expreſſions of ardent love to him: and this is, that God may appear to be juſt, therefore he proceedeth to give ſentence according to what is manifeſt to all; for faith is hid in the heart, and not ſeen nor known.</p>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:53450:31"/>
                     <p>M. <hi>B.</hi> 3. <hi>There is a promiſe made to them,</hi> 1. Tim. 4.8. <hi>Godlineſs hath the promiſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Some by Godlineſs in that place, underſtand the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of faith, by which we become Saints towards God, and indeed all true piety is vertually included in it. 2. Actual holineſs is produced by it; and if the promiſes were to this active righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, yet not primarily, nor yet cauſally, but by reaſon of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, the ſole root and foundation of it. <hi>There is a ſecret faith in all that we do,</hi> ſaith <hi>Luther;</hi> and unto this, God, in his promiſes of any good, hath reſpect; and for it, or more truely to Chriſt apprehended by faith, is the promiſe made: ſo that in hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt, we have all the promiſes, elſe we have none. Yet it's more plaine and direct to take Godlineſs in that ſenſe it is in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Great is the myſtery of godlineſs;</hi> that is, of Chriſtian religion in general: but all tendeth to one, though this ſeemeth to me to be the meaning of it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, You ſay, <hi>That the promiſes lye ſcattered up and downe in the word of God, ſo that to every godly action thou doeſt, there is a promiſe of eternal life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> If every Godly action have a promiſe of eternal life, then either ſo many actions, ſo many eternal lives be due; as where promiſe is of twelve pence a day to a labourer, and ſo many dayes work, ſo many twelve pences become due: or at leaſt, there be ſo many rights and intereſts in it as be holy actions. But eternal life can but be due to all holy actions joyntly, and to no one ſingly, if it ſhould be due to works. 2. It is true, that promiſes be ſo made in the Law, wherein there is a concatenation, or linking of all in one; yet they are upon ſuch hard conditions, that it is poor comfort, and ſmall or no hope of having any performed, it being impoſſible. The Law is weak through the fleſh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. but the New Teſtament is upon better promiſes, which are ſure to faith, becauſe they are made to Chriſt. He ſaith not, <hi>The promiſes be made to ſeeds, as of, many, but to his ſeed, as of one;</hi> that is, Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the collection of the ſcattered promiſes is in Chriſt onely, and by union with him, we come to have in tereſt and right to them all; and not by our works.</p>
                     <p>M. <hi>B. Though God be not a debtor to thee, yet he is to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to his own faithfulneſs.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> God is a debter to whom he made the promiſe, which is not to himſelf, but to Chriſt, whom he hath ordained and given for a covenant to his people, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.8.</p>
                     <p>M. <hi>B.</hi> You add, <hi>O Lord, It was free for thee before thou hadſt promiſed, whether thou wouldſt give me heaven or no; but now the word is out of thy mouth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If God were free and at liberty, not to give you heaven, untill he ſaw ſome of your good works to promiſe it unto, Then, 1. there is no firm decree in the minde of God, or purpoſe to ſave you from eternity. Or, 2. It is not founded upon grace, but works foreſeen; but now he hath written your name in the book of life, and it is now become his will to give you the Kingdome; for you have ſo pleaſed him with your holy duties, that you have moved him to make you a promiſe of it. This is your way: I would beloath to wrong you; neither is it a pleaſure to me to let any ſee your nakedneſs; but onely you have forced me to let you ſee how you publiſh your own errours or failings, while you ſeek the ſhame of others. Further, was it not as free for God whether he would have made a promiſe to <hi>Adam</hi> for the recovery of life and felicity, and whether it ſhould be of meer grace, or of works? 2. The Papiſts now do diſclaim proper merit, and claim all as belonging to works <hi>ex vi promiſſionis.</hi> 3.

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true, God is faithful, and ſo all that walk in in the ſteps of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, do judge him to be, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.20. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.11. but that covenant of ſure mercies and peace is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the rock Chriſt, and not on the ſandy ground of works. 2. To that of <hi>David, Bernard</hi> underſtandeth it of imputed and paſſive righteouſneſs, which he ſaith alſo is ours by the gratious act of free donation, when we were yet ſinners, as it is ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.15. the gift of righteouſneſs. 3. That faithful ſaying of <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. is, that Chriſt came to ſave ſinners; directly againſt you, who teach that our good works have the promiſe: then muſt we be good our ſelves firſt, before we can do good, and ſo not ſinners, and that ſalvation is not for ſinners, but the godly. Laſtly, the faithful labour, and ſuffer ſhame, becauſe they know and are aſſured aforehand by their faith in Chriſt entitling them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, that they have in heaven an enduring ſubſtance; that glory and kingdome laid up and reſerved in Chriſt, will more then coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervail all their labour and loſs for his names and truths ſake; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>ult.

Now this is but to taſte and know the inward and hidden goodneſs of the tree by the fruits, and ſo to judge and determine of it: but he that hath no ſurer and cleerer teſtimony within himſelf, will ſtill be uncertain and wavering; for how can works certifie me of my eſtate, further then I know &amp; ſee aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that they a riſe &amp; come from true Faith? then we muſt firſt know that we have Faith, which hath a cleer evidence in it ſelf, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. and yet is Faith more out of queſtion, when we feel it work by love, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14.

All the Orthodox deny the promiſe of the Goſpel to be conditional: for if good works be conditions of life in the Covenant of Grace, what then are the conditions of the Covenant of works? Or wherein do they differ? As this is to confound Law and Goſpel,<note place="margin">Nata eſt in ſcholis Pſeudo Apoſtolorum.</note> thus to diſtinguiſh between juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and ſalvation; ſo it is remarkable that this diſtinction and queſtion did firſt come out of the ſchool of the falſe Prophets, who thereby occaſioned great diſturbance in the Church, as <hi>Act.</hi> 15.1, 5.

If Chriſt ever purchaſed glory, juſtification, and ſalvation for us, it was when and while we were ſinners and enemies, or not at all, for he purchaſed nothing ſince ye became holy, and a friend to God or him; neither needed to purchaſe righteouſneſs and life for any, but ſinners.

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53450:37"/>onely Faith in Chriſt is neceſſary to ſalvation: the promiſes of life are made to the believer, and good works have the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of life; every good work thou canſt do, hath a promiſe made to it of eternal life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you both leave your reader uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain what your opinion is; and theſe will in no wiſe conſiſt together, beſides many other like paſſages. Alſo, here you ſay he grants it a rule; and yet do charge him with the total abolition of it, <hi>pag.</hi> 43. Is not this inconſiſtency? You ſay he granteth it hardly; nay doth it freely without conſtraint. <hi>B. And ſeldom. Anſ.</hi> If need require, he will do it <hi>toties quoties.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is not to kick all down again, to ſay the Law, if it rule, it doth alſo reign; the latter doth not overthrow the former, but onely it croſſeth and overthroweth your vain and ayry con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of a Law ruling and not reigning. You ſay, he thinks it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that one act of the Law ſhould be without the other. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here you wrong your adverſary; he ſpeaks of a power, and you of an act. The Law may actually condemn, where and when it cannot actually juſtifie (as it condemneth every tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, but can juſtifie onely the innocent) and yet the power for to do both is equally in it as a Law. Why do you not anſwer the enſuing Queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> Can you put your Conſcience under the Mandatory power, and yet keep it from under the damnatory? The Law bids you love your neighbour, though your enemy: and preſuppoſe you are obedient thereunto, yet do you do it ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, that the Law hath no power to reprove and condemn you in that particular? If the Law condemn you not, away with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, Confeſſion, Repentance, Juſtification, and all living by Faith in Chriſt. For now you can ſo walk according to the rule of the Law, that it cannot ſubject you to the curſe and death: you are not reproved and judged in your ſelf for any thing: your peace and ſafety is by your juſt life, the Law being curbed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, or rather, exauthorized, or diſ-inveſted of all power to condemn: and your life and comfort is not by your Faith in the Son of God, who loved you and gave himſelf for you, as <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.21. <hi>There is no condemnation unto you,</hi> (not becauſe you are in Chriſt, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. but) the reaſon is, in that the Law though a rule, yet wanteth power to reign to death. We often meet with this groundleſs and falſe aſſertion: and now ſee what is the chief ſtone that you ſtumble at. Let this now ſuffice.</p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The word <hi>they,</hi> relates not to believers, if you look the place, as here you do intimate. You onely repeat what we write, but confute nothing.</p>

                        <hi>M.</hi> B. <hi>The ſame Author at another time, calls it a ſlander to ſay they deny the Law: who can reconcile ſuch contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſee no contradiction, nor ſhew of any: you might tell your Reader wherein it lyeth; for all are not ſo quick-ſighted as your ſelf. But is not this a contradiction in you, who ſay, that we grant the Law to be a rule, and that a believer is a free keeper of it; and yet that we hold and teach the abolition of it? Here the task to reconcile is now yours. Alſo, that we deny the Law, abideth ſtill a ſlander, for which the Law is againſt you. See the the ninth Commandment. The Lord layeth it not unto your charge.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>M.</hi> B. p. 52. <hi>The ſecond interpretation is of the damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and curſing power of the Law: the Law is not made to a believer ſo as he ſhould abide under the curſing and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power of it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> You might remember, that right now you ſaid, The Law a believer is under, hath no power to condemn and curſe; what need he, or how can he then be freed from the curſing pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? See your own inſtance. If the fire had no power to burn, what need was there that God ſhould hinder the act? You would ſaign ſuch a fire, as is without all power to burn, and tell us of ſuch a Law as wanteth power to condemn? who will now fear either? or rather, who can credit ſuch vain words? Your ſword cuts the throat of the owner; for from the removal or reſtraint of the act or operation, the Argument doth not hold for the removal of the thing, or the power to condemn, but rather on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, it ſtrongly and neceſſarily inferreth and concludeth, that there is ſuch a condemning power in the Law, in that it is reſtrained and hindered from the actual doing of it. But ſecondly, here is no ſuch miracle wrought upon the Law, as was there upon the fire, which kept it from burning the three worthies, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.23, 25.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53450:38"/>though more abundant mercy be ſhewed: for Chriſt was made under the Law, to redeem us from under it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. Not to take the curſe from the Law, but to redeem us. In what ſenſe, and to what end Chriſt was under as our ſurety, in the ſame ſenſe are we freed: but he was under both the rule and raign of it. Yet it will not follow that believers are in no ſtate of ſubjection and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience: or being enlarged, and ſet at liberty, do not run the way of Gods Commandments. For they do it, though by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther efficient, from a new principle, and for a different end then that of the Law, <hi>Do and live.</hi> They are under Chriſt, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and led by his Spirit, who is the head and husband of his Church. But of this more afterwards.</p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> You would ſtill bear men in hand that we are againſt the uſe of the Law, which yet we do ſtand for, if lawfully uſed, as your Text requireth; and that in all the Authority and Offices of it; and this we can and are ready to make good upon occaſion: yet ſince this is ſo often inculcated by you, I wiſh you would give ſatisfaction in theſe few things. Firſt, If the Spirit make the will and affections free to what is good, doth it alter and enlighten the underſtanding alſo, to know what is truth and good, and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally encline, move, guide, and lead aright, without the direction and regulating of the Law? doth the Spirit, which is light, and giveth all light and directive power to the Law, need the Law in his work?</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Your reaſon is much unlike: for firſt, the Doctrine of the Goſpel is not onely the object of Faith, but the outward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument and ordinary means the Spirit uſeth both to implant faith and to increaſe it: to regenerate to Faith,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.</note> and to confirm and build up in that way; which you nor any can truly affirm of the Law. Now this your Rock is paſſed by without danger.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>M.</hi> B. <hi>The</hi> Swinckfeildeans, <hi>upon like ground, deny the whole Scripture to be needful to a man that hath the Spirit: and that which the Antinomian doth limit to the Law, that it is a killing letter, they apply to the whole Scripture: and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee how they can eſcape this Argument.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſee, with a little help, the light may ſo ſhine forth, that there is hope you will prove ours: however, we are not here non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pluſſed. See the errour of the <hi>Swinckfeild,</hi> and your own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: firſt if we were perfectly holy and happy, as in Heaven and Glory, we ſhould not need the Scripture, no more then the Angels do. 2 But we are ſo onely imperfectly and inchoatly, ſo that the Scriptures are ſtill requiſite and needful, that we may increaſe with the increaſings of God. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.12. <hi>for the perfecting of the Saints—Till we come to the unity of the Faith, unto a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt.</hi> 3 Again, your friend the Antinomian doth not call the Law a killing letter, as it is without the Spirit, but as it is that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, or the miniſtration the Spirit uſeth to kill and condemn, as touching Conſcience, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.9.</p>

                        <hi>I was alive without the Law once, but when the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment came, ſin revived, and I died,</hi> Rom. 7.9.</p>
                     <p>But this may ſerve now, <hi>viz.</hi> The Law can but direct in the things of the Law: where you can finde no Chriſtian eſtate, nature, name, way, life, faith, nor hope of his Calling nor, to ſpeak
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53450:39"/>properly, any thing of Chriſtianity. How now ſhall your Law direct in theſe things?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>M.</hi> B. <hi>The Law muſt needs have a directive, regulating, and informing power over a godly man, as will appear by theſe two Reaſons. Firſt, we cannot diſcern the true worſhip of God from ſuperſtition and idolatry, but by the firſt and ſecond Commandment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here is a large field,<note place="margin">Inopem copia facit.</note> this requireth a full Treatiſe it ſelf, as for the explicating it in ſuch manner as may ſatisfie mens minds, being concerning this full of darkneſs and doubts; ſo for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral neceſſity of ſome cleer and ſpecial light to be held forth for the informing and directing aright; a world of people going far wide, through want of this true knowledge. In brief, thus for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: Firſt, God was not onely a God unto his people, but had made known alſo himſelf unto them, before the ſolemn giving of the Law: and he gave not the Law, that by the obſervation and works of it he might be their God, and they his people; nor yet that thereby they might know and conceive of him in their hearts according to that Law of works. And therefore is it obſervable, that he beginneth with theſe words, <hi>Hear, O Iſrael, I am thy God,</hi> &amp;c. Now as he became their God onely by Chriſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed ſeed, in the face of whom the knowledge of his glory is manifeſted, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. ſo his redeemed and peculiar were onely to take notice of him as God in Chriſt reconciling them to himſelf, bleſſing all in the alone Meſſiah, giving out all peace &amp; life through him, and vouchſafing all favour and reſpect onely in reference unto him. To this diſpenſation, manner, and kinde of revealing himſelf to mankinde (according to that firſt promiſe,<note place="margin">Dem, niſi in Chriſto ſuo, coli aut cognoſci no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit. <hi>Calv.</hi>

Now mans heart na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally is a ſhop of idolatry; infinite are the forms, conceptions, and images which we frame and have of God within us. And, as our inward Notions are, under which God cometh to our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, ſo we think of him, worſhip him, ſeek to pleaſe him, and lay a foundation for expecting and receiving ſome good from him. And what inſcription the Athenians had on their Altar, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.23. the ſame may be found on a world of our devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:53450:39"/>all being to an unknown God. For as Chriſt ſaid to the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Samaria,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Serviunt Deo qui tantum o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinionabiliter, non natura eſt deus.</note> for the moſt part we worſhip we know not what, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. for he is onely a God in our opinion and conceit, and not in truth and his own nature, who accepteth, reſpecteth, loveth, or bleſſeth any, for any work, worth, or goodneſs of theirs; but the true reaſon and ground of all favour is Chriſt. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.6.<note place="margin">Nam verus &amp; naturalis Deus ſic loquitur: Nulla religio ſapientia, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </note> Thus he that in his thoughts falleth from that true knowledge of Chriſt, and that in him he is well pleaſed with him, pacified to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, receiveth, loveth him, without and before any actual holineſs and work, or performance of his, he neceſſarily falleth forthwith into Idolatry: becauſe he cannot now but imagine ſuch a God, and frame him in his own minde, which is nowhere to be found. A God out of Chriſt without a Mediatour, not ſatisfied, reconciled, at peace with us, propitious to us,<note place="margin">Omnis lomo qui relabitus a cognitione Chriſti neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio ruit in Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lolatriam, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but requiring and reſpecting ſome duty or holineſs in us, to move him to grant us acceſs, audience, and all bleſſings needful: an abſolute God, clothed with glorious attributes, terrible to ſinners (and not juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the ungodly through Faith in Chriſt, nor loving us when we were enemies, and ſo by his own hand and work reconciling us to himſelf, without any of ours, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8, 9.) ſuch a God do many ſet up in their hearts, and they frame their devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, works, and ways ſuitable with this their image: ſeeking in their own righteouſneſs and holineſs to draw nigh, and that ſome goodneſs or qualification of theirs ſhould commend and ingratiate them unto him.

                     <p>Now, as we may plainly ſee, that the Preface of the Decologue relateth to the Covenant of Grace, of Promiſe of peace and life in the Meſſiah, in which God did commend and make known himſelf what a God he would be unto them, in what way he would deal with them, and give them all their peace: ſo God, to keep this light in them, to ſuppreſs or prevent all Idolatry, or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and falſe conceivings and imaginations of him (contrary to that his promiſe, whereunto mans nature is exceedingly prone) therefore ſaith, <hi>I am thy God</hi> (as I have made my ſelf formerly known unto thee) <hi>and thou ſhalt have no other:</hi> as not worſhip
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:53450:40"/>ſtocks and ſtones, ſo not form and conceive otherwiſe of me in thy heart and minde.</p>
                     <p>And verily, as the heavenly light of this true knowledge of God which did appear in the word and work of atonement by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, began to be eclipſed and darkened in the Church, ſo idolatry and ſuperſtition crept in and prevailed, till at laſt it became palpably groſs, by Images Pictures, uſing of Saints for Advocates, and the like. And the bright and glorious ariſing and ſhining forth of the Sun of Righteouſneſs, who hath health under his wings, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.4. will prove the alone effectual means to diſperſe, diſpel, demoliſh, and aboliſh all that traſh and ſuperſtitions va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and to inſtruct and guide mens ſouls aright into the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the true God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>M.</hi> B. <hi>The practical uſe is,— to pray and labour for ſuch a free and heavenly heart, that the Law of God may not be a terrour to you.</hi>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> You have taken a courſe for that aforehand; for how can the Law be a terrour, while you teach that it cannot curſe nor condemn? but thus a mans heart may flatter him with a falſe peace in the way of legal conformity, having not attained to the righteouſneſs of Faith or of Chriſt. Again, that Spirit which maketh the heart ſo free and heavenly, that the precepts of the Law are ſweetneſs and delight, cometh not by the Miniſtery of the Law, but of the Goſpel: this is not the Spirit of bondage to fear, but of Adoption, Grace, and love. Therefore let us pray and labour that the Goſpell may have a free paſſage, and be glorified.</p>

I ſay ſtill, The law hath power from the Author of it, indifferently to command and to condemne; If the Law of our Land ſhould never condemne or puniſh actually for murder, becauſe no man-ſlayer is to be found, yet it hath power to do it nvertheleſs when occaſion ſhall ſerve.</p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Theſe are but your words, without warrant or weight, which can never carry it: your part is to refell the contrary. 2. If there be ſuch a law which can onely direct and oblige to it, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Argument may ſeem to be invalid, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. ſaying, <hi>They that are of the works of the Law are curſed,</hi> &amp;c. for a
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53450:41"/>man may be of the works of the Law, as it is of power to oblige to direct and oblige only, ſay you, and yet be exempt and free from the curſe. I much marvel that you or any can ſuppoſe a law obliging to it for obedience, and yet not obliging or binding to anſwer for diſobedience. <hi>Whatever the Law ſaith, it ſaith to them that are under the law: that every mouth may be ſtopped, and all the world become guilty before God.</hi> Rom. 3.19. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſay you, lyeth the eſſence of ſin that it breaketh the Law; which ſuppoſeth the obligatory force of it. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Sin is a ſwerving from the rule of direction, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.4. But can there be ſin, and not guilt? or can you ſuppoſe a man to be formally a ſinner, and yet out of condemnation by the law, by preventing that conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, as you call it? Laſtly, a man is properly odious and hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to God, in that he is a ſinner; and not as he is guilty and ſubject to the curſe, which be the effects of juſtice, occaſioned only by ſin.</p>

                        <hi>M.</hi> B. <hi>God, by reaſon of the dominion he had over man, might have commanded obedience, and yet never a promiſe of eternal life.</hi>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> To what purpoſe do you here tell us what God might have done, where the queſtion is of what God hath done, what a law he hath made and put man under, which, as it commandeth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, ſo it condemneth diſobedience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.8, 9. <hi>Who</hi> (God) <hi>will render unto every one according to his deeds, to them who by patient continuance in well-doing, ſeek for glory, and honor, and immortality, eternal life: But to them who are contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteouſneſs, indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and wrath.</hi> Is not here the expreſs and full minde of God in his law? and will you curtaile or conceal any part of it? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, how can it ſtand with divine juſtice, to conſtitute a Law, without power to puniſh tranſgreſſors? when he giveth his law in charge, he ſaith, <hi>That he ſetteth before them life and death, bleſſing and curſing,</hi> Deut. 30.19. You may long tell any ſober underſtanding man, that he may ſafely put his hand into the fire, it cannot burn him, for there may be a fire without power to burn, before you can perſwade him unto it. And yet God hath ſufficient power to do this alſo.</p>

                        <hi>M.</hi> B. <hi>As for the other conſequent act of the law, to curſe
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:53450:41"/>and puniſh; that is but an accidental act, and not neceſſary to a law, for it cometh in upon ſuppoſition of a tranſgreſſion; and therefore as we may ſay of a Magiſtrate. He was a juſt and compleat Magiſtrate for his time, though he put forth no pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitive juſtice, if there be no malefactors offending; ſo is it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a law.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Apoſtle in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19. doth ſtrongly and convincing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conclude againſt you <hi>viz.</hi> that the moral law came in with power, not only to direct, but to reveal wrath, curſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne: for, ſaith he, <hi>It was added becauſe of tranſgreſſion;</hi> that is, to accuſe and convince of it, and to condemne for it, that ſo it might be ſubſervient to the promiſe, in preparing the heart for Chriſt the bleſſed Seed. This is plaine to be Gods intent, in giving and bringing in his law at the firſt by <hi>Moſes.</hi> except you can, ſince then, let us ſee how it is altered, or where and when the law was onely given to direct and oblige, the other authority and power being denied it, or rather taken away from it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As for your inſtance in the Magiſtrate, I anſwer, If the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate have no power to puniſh, he is no compleat Magiſtrate. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.4. <hi>He is a miniſter of God, a revenger to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute wrath upon him that doth evil:</hi> this is one maine part of his effice, and as effential to it, as it is to countenance and defend the innocent and good. Alſo 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Governours be ſent</hi> (of purpoſe) <hi>for the puniſhment of evil doers, and for the praiſe of them that do well.</hi> 2. Your other inſtance of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed Angels, is as ineffectual. They were under a law, ſay you. Anſwer, Well, it is true; and thoſe that fell, are condemned by that law they were under. And now ſuppoſe any of them that do ſtand, ſhould yet ſin as did the other, would they not fall into the ſame condemnation? It may be diſputable: yet it is currant with moſt, that the Elect Angels are confirmed by Chriſt; now I would learn, Whether the benefit they have by Chriſt, is, in that the condemning power is taken from the Law they live under, ſo that though they fall, it cannot hurt them; or is it in that they are upheld, and eſtabliſhed in their integrity that they cannot fall as did the evil angels, and yet the condemnation remaineth in the law ſtill? Who then do now need moſt rectifying? I fear you wittingly do oppoſe the truth: And your manner of replying doth
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:53450:42"/>confirme this my opinion. If what is ſaid be true and evident, let it leave you ſatisfied, and not go on againſt the clear light.</p>

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:53450:42"/>that ſtill the ſoul, elevated and kept above in ſaith, by which it liveth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. would be found in Chriſt, having his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, which is perfect and everlaſting; and not having its own righteouſneſs, which is of the law, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. If there be no curſe nor danger in the works of our own righteouſneſs, or of the law, (it having loſt its condemning power, as you affirme) why ſhould <hi>Paul</hi> be afraid to be found there? But in temptation, and the time of inward conflict, the truth, benefit, and neceſſity of this will better appear, and ſo be diſcerned and readily received; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out temptation <hi>Chriſtianus nullus eſt.</hi> It ſeemeth your ſpirits live and abide under the law, as under a quiet and peaceable go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, without ſenſe or fear of condemnation, and without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward moleſtation or chock of conſcience, in that you tell us of being under both the natural and moral law, and yet free from condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of either. And you would patronize <hi>D.T. Regula vitae,</hi> and yet dare not, nor cannot do <hi>planè &amp; plenè.</hi> I finde you in doctrine agreeing with Doctor <hi>Laud,</hi> who in a Sermon on <hi>Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wedneſday</hi> before the King, his text being <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.16. ſaid, that the old pathes wherein we might reſt, were the Creed, the Lords Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the ten Commandments: and added, that the law was like unto a ſerpent at the hedge bottome, which had loſt its ſting. I believed him not, though you do. And ſo he told the King and the reſt, what a peſtilential ſect the Antinomians were; and thus he did labour, as you do, to make the world believe that there are ſome aboliſhers of the law, &amp; that theſe againſt whom you write, and all others who go in the ſame way, are ſuch, and ſo not to be tolerated in the kingdome. And about the ſame time D. <hi>Gifford,</hi> after many invectives againſt that ſect and ſort (for it is ſpoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt everywhere, <hi>Act.</hi> 28.22.) in the cloſure he gave this wiſe admonition to his hearers, <hi>viz. To repent, to believe, and to do as they ſhould do,</hi> and ſo he would warrant them to be ſaved. Here was repentance, faith, and inchoate obedience, as in your friend D. <hi>Tailer;</hi> but in which will you place ſalvation? In all, you and theſe your complices do ſay and teach; and then in none at all, doth the truth of God ſay; for, <hi>If ye be circumciſed, Chriſt profiteth nothing,</hi> Gal. 5.2. You cannot but ſee, as D. <hi>Tailor</hi> in that his book, ſo others of great note amongſt you, to preach and print many erroneous things; and why do you not blaze, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove

I doubt it, or you come forth thus <hi>Goliah</hi>-like to ſhew your valour, and to defie the family of faith. And ſo to gratifie others, you are reſolved to venture againſt the pikes of old tryed and pure truth, innocency, and a good conſcience. Well, henceforth be better adviſed: like one bemiſted, you have miſtaken your way, miſrepreſented your adverſaries, and run your credit, cauſe, and conſcience into a great hazard; and you may expect worſe in all theſe, without wiſe and timely retreat.

And here faith doth not ſtand bound to give ear to the voice of either implanted, or moral law, for the procuring or preſervation of peace and comfort; but turning from both, and not regarding them, doth direct and confine ear, eye the thoughts and meditations of the ſoul to that alone ſimple object Chriſt, and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:53450:43"/>to what he ſpeaketh in the word of grace and ſalvation, whoſe blood ſprinkled and ſhed for remiſſion of ſins, cryeth for better things then the blood of <hi>Abel.</hi> This is the proper office, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and exerciſe of faith.

Thus every high thing exalting it ſelf againſt the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God according to the Goſpel, is to be caſt down, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thought to be brought into captivity to the obedience of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4, 5.

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Your terms are ambiguous; by that word <hi>immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> may be thought as if your adverſary denyed all uſe of means, as an <hi>Euthuſiaſt;</hi> or elſe, that Chriſt communicateth himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſinner can or do prepare to meet him or receive him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording, to that of the prophet, <hi>I am found of them that ask not after me,</hi> Iſa. 65.1. as he called <hi>Matthew</hi> ſitting at the receit of cuſtome, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.9. and <hi>Peter, Andrew, James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> Mat. 4.18, 21.

                     <p n="2">2. You ſay to groſs ſinners. Do you make a difference before Chriſt and Faith come? <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, There is no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the profane Gentile, and legal Jew <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.9. the Jew is in no wiſe better then the other; although the blinde Phariſee thought and judged otherwiſe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.11. or is not Chriſt as free for one ſinner as another; for a groſs and great offender, an idolater, a Necromancer, as <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> a blaſphemer, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuter, as <hi>Paul;</hi> for Publicans and harlors, as for a refined and reformed legaliſt? Alas, Sir, what then ſhall become of all groſs ſinners, if Chriſt may not communicate himſelf unto them? you would have them amended firſt; that may like you but it pleaſeth not Chriſt, who is moſt glorified in the chief of ſinners, like that skilful phyſician whoſe art and faithfulneſs doth beſt appear in the healing and recovery of a patient deſperately ſick. But by what power or means ſhall a groſs ſinner reforme and amend, before Chriſt come to him, who ſaid truly, <hi>Without me yo can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing?</hi> you ſeem by this book to be juſt of the elder brothers, that is, the Phariſees minde <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.12. who was offended, and murmured becauſe the looſe and ſinful prodigal was ſo freely received, and kindly welcomed and entertained.

If you think that a man muſt or may prepare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, you are not ſo Orthodox, as to hold us paſſive at the firſt receiving of Chriſt. 2. You ſtumble at the ſimilitude uſed; but have not other approved Divines compared Gods dealing with man at firſt, to a riders rough handling of a wilde colt, who is forced to caſt him ere he can ſhooe him, and by a ſtrong hand, and ſharpe uſage, to ſubdue, break and tame him? Neither of theſe do imply any more then is warranted, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.18. and other places. Are you of opinion that God in the converſion of a ſinner doth nothing againſt the will of man? look then on <hi>Manaſſes, Paul,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Adigondo pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiam.</note> the <hi>Jailor;</hi> was there not violence done, whilſt God uſeth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions without, and the terrors of the law within, driving ſin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the conſcience, and ſo compelleth the man to come in? <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.23. no bitter potion, or aloes, is ſo unpleaſant and loathſome unto the body, as the due working of the law is ingrateful to the conſcience: beſides, the patient knowing that his phyſick is given not to kill, but of purpoſe and with a minde to prevent death, and to cure the diſeaſed body, will more willingly receive and digeſt what is ſo untoothſome: but the ſoul, when the law revealeth ſin and wrath, and the ſpirit of bondage beginneth to work, knoweth nothing of Gods purpoſe herein, unleſs it be that his minde is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy; and therefore it doth ſtruggle, and refiſt, as much as in it lyeth. It may be truly ſaid in a good ſenſe, that God, who work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Will and the Deed, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12. doth ſave a man againſt his will: for man of himſelf is both unwilling to ſuffer and abide the work of God in him and upon him, and alſo to have ſalvation in
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:53450:46"/>Gods way; therefore ſaid Chriſt, <hi>You will not come unto me, that ye may have life,</hi> Joh. 5.40. and <hi>none will come, unleſs the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther draw him,</hi> Joh. 6.44. And how often would God humble us, and yet we will not be humbled! man ſtandeth out till he be made to yeeld. A frantick man will not be bound or cured; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, he is held captive, and letted by Satan, though voluntarily: the ſtrong man muſt firſt therefore be caſt out by one ſtronger, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.2. Yet being overcome, converted, and made willing by the Spirit of God, his will believeth, converteth and inclineth according to the way and voice of the Goſpel; ſo not at firſt, but afterward, man being changed, is become willing and active.</p>

                        <hi>M.</hi> B. page 86. <hi>Yet fifthly, We may hold truly ſome ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaneous works upon the heart before theſe graces be beſtowed on us: this take to antidote againſt the Antinomians, who ſpeak conſtantly of the ſouls taking Chriſt, while it is a griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous polluted ſoul.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is no ſuch fear of hurt by your Antinomian doctrine, as you ſtill pretend; but is far more danger in your ſo many antidotes; and the poiſon, as is now apparent, lyeth and lurketh elſewhere. But that the world may yet more fully and cleerly ſee how in this alſo you wrong your adverſaries, 1. It is evident, that both the <hi>honey-combe,</hi> and the <hi>Aſſertion</hi> do grant and teach as much concerning the antecedaneous work upon the ſoul (as it is Gods, and not mans) as you can rightly call for. And whereas D. <hi>Criſpe</hi> doth compare God to a phyſician ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently working upon, and inforcing his patient, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Is not that a ſufficient preparative? yet further, God giveth, ſaith he, an heart to deſire and receive Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now who can be ſuppoſed to have an heart deſirous of Chriſt, but he that is a ſenſible ſinner, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of his fearful eſtate without Chriſt, and convinced with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that Chriſt, and Chriſt alone, can reconcile and ſave? The a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone tender of our Saviour to any, doth imply a loſt condition without him; and may not God even then let the ſoul ſee it hath no Chriſt, and ſo is in ſin and death? and thus awakening it, at that preſent ſtir up the deſire and longing after him for ſalvation; and ſo that free and gracious tender of a Saviour to ſuch, becometh very ſeaſonable and acceptable. I muſt you will ſo vainely quarrel
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:53450:46"/>with your friends, and the truth too. Oh, but this will not be received, that the ſoul ſhould take Chriſt while it is a grievous polluted ſoul; we have this often ſet before us and I think it is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently anſwered; at leaſt, I grow almoſt weary in replying unto it. Will you have this ſo polluted ſoul to be half, or in part waſhed and cleanſed before Chriſt do it? 2. Do you think that the tears of repentance, humiliation, confeſſion. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have power to waſh the ſoul from ſin, as you know Doctor <hi>T.</hi> did teach? or will ſuch acts or exerciſes diminiſh the evil of ſin? when a man is made to know and feel into what wo and miſery his ſin hath plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him he cannot by that think better of himſelf, but only griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, complaineth and feareth the more. Thus I write, becauſe (which is the beſt I can make of it) I take your meaning to be, that Chriſt ſhould be tendered to none, but to ſuch as feelingly do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their ſin. Now the ſenſe of ſickneſs and pain doth no whit extenuate the ſame: or the confeſſion of a great debt, is no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement of it. Further, when the woman with the bloody iſſue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, and ſought to many for cure and health in vain, was ſhe by that diſeaſed the leſs in body? yea, or when through the ſame or report of Chriſt, ſhe was ſtrongly perſwaded, that if ſhe could but touch the hem of his garment, ſhe ſhould recover; did even this perſwaſion remedy her diſeaſe, till that vertue went from Chriſt to effect the cure? Two blind men cryed, <hi>Lord, that we might ſee;</hi> and were they leſs blind therefore, before Chriſt open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their eyes, then other blind folke who did not ſo complain, nor ſeek to Chriſt? Indeed, theſe two were not contented with that comfortleſs condition: but that did aggravate miſery, and afflict more, rather then mitigate and eaſe it; only the uncertain hope of ſome help, did ſomewhat ſuſtaine and relieve their ſpirits. And ſo to conclude, the ſoul is not leſs polluted, when it knoweth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth with tears its great pollutions: and whatever work or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe elſe you will put the ſoul unto, it will not thereby ceaſe to be polluted as much as before, for its no act or work of mans, but Gods only, that cleanſeth and healeth ſin.</p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Your <hi>if,</hi> importeth that you queſtion the matter, and do rather incline to hold the law in it ſelf a covenant of grace: and if it be a covenant of grace, then it is not a covenant of works, for grace and works be as two things moſt contrary, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not agree, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.6. 2. If the law in it ſelf was a covenant of grace, then there were two of grace. 3. You would confound Law and Goſpel, which you told us out of <hi>Luther,</hi> are to be kept at a like diſtance as heaven and earth. 4. <hi>Yet it was given Evangelically,</hi> ſay you. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Who can credit you in this? for the law came in a terrible manner, as in thunders and lighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: and the Lord deſcended upon mount <hi>Sinai</hi> in fire, and the whole mount quaked greatly, ſo that all the people trembled, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.16, 18. But the Goſpel came in a joyful manner. The Angels ſaid unto the ſhepherds, <hi>Fear not, for behold. I bring you tidings of great joy, which ſhall be to all people,</hi> Luk. 2.10. Neither was the law in a proper and ſtrict ſenſe given for Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical purpoſes, for God purpoſed by his Goſpel to give pardon, freedom, peace, joy, refreſhing, health, and reſt to the ſouls and conſciences of his people; but by the law he intended to reveal ſin and wrath, to terrifie, wound, and condemn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe two mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations are to produce two contrary effects; for humbling, bruiſing, and beating down of the ſoul, being convinced of ſin, guilty of death, and worthy of Gods everlaſting wrath, is the true and proper effect of the law, and that for which it was eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially given, as <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19. Wherefore then ſerveth the law? it was
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:53450:47"/>added becauſe of tranſgreſſions; that is, to diſcover them, to cauſe fear and horrour in the conſcience, and ſo to conclude or ſhut up the ſoul under a fearful and inevitable bondage and male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, <hi>verſe</hi> 22. And thus did <hi>Paul</hi> ſet up the law in a moſt horrid and terrible manner, as if there were no Chriſt, neither grace or redemption to be expected from God, as <hi>Luther</hi> ſaith: ſo that the miſtake is wholly yours. And if no ſuch indignation, and terrour be by the law, what need a Mediatour for reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and peace? or Chriſt to be a Sanctuary or hiding place? or any to flie to him for refuge and ſalvation? It ſeemeth you would have the law to be preached more mildly then ſome An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomians do, and with much mitigation of juſtice: and yet you blame others for too little law: you are not good to pleaſe: and few mens Miniſtery like you, ſo as doth your own. But this I dare ſay, he that was never killed, was never made alive; where the law worketh not to condemnation, there the Goſpel never brought juſtification to life. And by this meanes the law is ſubordinate and ſubſervient, in making ſenſible of ſin, guilt, and damnation, in ſuppreſſing and deſtroying that peſtilent opinion, and conceit, which every one hath of himſelf, his own ſtrength and righteouſneſs. And laſtly, when a man lyeth in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable and deſperate caſe, ſighing, and lamenting under that burden of fin and wrath, in making to deſire and ſeek after help and remedy. And in a remote and general ſenſe, or acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally, it may be ſaid to have Evangelical purpoſes, in that all hope of righteouſneſs, acceptance, and life, being quite loſt, and gone by the Law, the minde and intent of God hereby, is, to drive man to believe in JESUS CHRIST. But of this you will tell us your minde more fully afterwards, as you ſay.</p>

New here we cannot ſay, one is abſolutely better then another as the firſt eſtate of</hi> Adam <hi>did far exceed this in the rectitude it had</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Our ſlate of reparation without all controverſie doth far excell that of <hi>Adams</hi> innocency, even as an infinite Good exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a finite; yea and in reſpect of rectitude, immortality, and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, your three inſtances; but then we muſt believe more then
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:53450:49"/>we ſee or feel, yea, and things centrary to what theſe our ſenſes are ſet upon. In Chriſt Jeſus there is a new creation: old things are paſt, and all things are become new; he that by faith putteth on Chriſt, beareth the image of the heavenly, whereas the image of <hi>Adam</hi> was the image of an earthly man: As is the earthy, ſuch are they that are earthy; and as is the heavenly, ſuch are they that are heavenly. But our life is hid with Chriſt in God; and when Chriſt who is our life ſhall appear, then ſhall we alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear with him in glory. Againe, the ſtate of reparation is more excellent then that of innocency, in regard of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality: for the life that Chriſt hath purchaſed and brought to light, can never be extinguiſhed; it is an everlaſting life, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear, danger, or poſſibility of periſhing; here is no ſubjection nor propenſity to death or mortality; but <hi>Adams</hi> ſtate was not ſo abſolute and happy: and though the body dye, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man periſh, yet the ſtate is imperiſhable and unchangeable. And, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>He that believeth in me, ſhall never ſee death,</hi> Joh. 8.51. Laſtly, unto faith there is no infelicity: for all the creatures ſtand reconciled in Chriſt unto the believer; a firme and inviolable covenant is made for him with the beaſts of the field, the fowls of heaven and the creeping things of the ground, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.18. <hi>Job</hi> 5.23. Alſo croſſes, afflictions, tabulations, and death it ſelf, not only cannot ſeparate from the love of God in Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>ult.</hi> but all are yours, ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> for your furtherance and hope; the world, or life, or death, or things preſent, or things to come, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22. And all work together for good to them that love God <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. But this ſtate is not diſcerned, ſave by the eye of ſaith; yet this is the truth of the Chriſtian condition by the means of the blood of ſprinkling, which hath ſlaine and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed all enmity, and ſanctified all things unto us: and as it ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and is confirmed in the minde of God, and by him is reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and held forth in the word of atonement; he that is truly and effectually called by God, is ſtated in that grace and bleſſed condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where he is without fear or danger of evil. The defects or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections which you ſpeak of, are not in the ſtate, but in our ſight and apprehenſion: not in the thing or object, but in our little ſaith. The word and ordinances are left us to uſe, for the increaſing of our knowledge, faith, aſſurance, conſolation, and full contentment of our
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:53450:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>happy condition; but the ſtate it ſelf ſimply conſidered, is alway one and the ſame, neither ſubject to diminution, or to be augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; as the Sun is as glorious in it ſelf when it riſeth, as at mid-day, though not ſo to our ſight and ſenſes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>M.</hi>B. <hi>The next queſtion is Whether we may be now by Chriſt ſaid to be more righteous then</hi> Adam, <hi>for ſo an Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian in his Treatiſe of Juſtification, quoteth places out of ſome Authors</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The Author of that Treatiſe both in that book, and in his life, appeared to be as much, if not more, for the law, then any his accuſers. 2. You cannot deny, but that the quoted places do ſpeak fully home to what he affirmed and held; their expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have ſo puzzled you, that your Anſwer is ſilly and frivolous. For, 1. You grant the truth of all, but you muſt finde, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the ground they are to ſtand upon, whenas they had a more clear and firme ground before; but we will deal with you upon your own ground alſo. The Orthodox expreſs ſo much, ſay you, upon this ground, <hi>Becauſe the righteouſneſs of Chriſt as it was his, was of infinite value and conſequence, and ſo as we are in a Mediator, we are in a better and ſurer condition then the Angels or</hi> Adam. <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If it be of infinite price and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence as it was his, then it is ſo as it is imputed; for it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired or diminiſhed a whit by imputation; neither read you any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where that God impute th but only ſome piece or part of it; and alſo Chriſt ceaſeth not ſtill to be the Author and ſubject of it, though imputed to us, even as we are the Authors of ſin, and the ſubjects in whom ſin is ſeated, however it be imputed by him. <hi>He is the Lord our righteouſneſs,</hi> Jer. 23.6. and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.24. <hi>Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſhall one ſay, in the Lord have I righteouſneſs.</hi> In Chriſt are all the treaſures of his Church, and in him ſhe is compleat, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.3, 10. By her union with him ſhe hath communion in all his unſearchable riches,<note place="margin">Totus Chriſtus quantus &amp; qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis eſt. <hi>Luth.</hi>
                        </note> as hath the wife all by marriage with her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busband; <hi>uxor fulget mariti radiis,</hi> ſhe is beautiful by his beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Whole Chriſt is the believers, and not ſome portion of him. or of his treaſures. Of him (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) are ye in Chriſt Jeſus, who of God is made unto us wiſdom, and righteouſneſs, and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and redemption. In that Chriſt is ours, all his be ours, even his purity, holineſs, and perfections. Againe, this doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53450:50"/>infer, that imputed righteouſneſs is more excellent then that of <hi>Adams</hi> or Angels, in that theirs was finite, they being creatures, but Chriſts as imputed is infinite; Becauſe, 1. As Mediatour he is God-man, and therefore his perſon, obedience, and all things of him and from him be infinite, by reaſon of his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head. 2. What did fully ſatisfie the juſtice of God, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, that muſt needs be infinite: but that obedience and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs which God imputeth, was it that gave ſatisfaction to his infinite juſtice, for the almoſt-infinite fins of a world of men; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that imputed righteouſneſs muſt needs be infinite. As for your reaſons you bring after, they are ſo poor and weak, that they may well ſhame the owner. For, ſay you, It is only impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us for that righteouſneſs which we ought to have; it is not made ours in that latitude as it was in Chriſt but as we needed it. Now God never required of us greater righteouſneſs then <hi>Adam</hi> had; and therefore it is a ſenſeleſs thing to imagine, that that ſhould be made ours, which we never needed, nor were bound to have. <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I hope I have made it plaine, that it is ours in the ſame largeneſs it was in Chriſt. 2. Whereas you ſee no neceſſity of it, I affirme, that a greater righteouſneſs then <hi>Adam</hi> had, is needful and requiſite for the repairing and advancing of our condition, and that upon theſe grounds: 1. Suppoſe <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> after he had eaten of the fruit forbidden, had yet either the righteouſneſs implanted by creation preſerved in him without vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, or that God had reſtored it againe unto him preſently up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his fall; could this his righteouſneſs have done any more then anſwer and ſatisfie the righteouſneſs of the moral law for the time to come? and then it could not make amends for the diſobedience or fact againſt the poſitive law, and ſo redeem him and his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from death, hell, and the devil; therefore a greater was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. 2. There ſeemeth to me to be more poiſon in fin, then that the goodneſs of any or all created righteouſneſs ſhould be able to equipoize or countervaile the evil of it; for in the tranſgreſſing of the law, there is alſo <hi>laeſio majeſtatis:</hi> ſin reflects upon the law. giver alſo contemning his authority, rebelling againſt him; <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo in regard of God vilified in the breaking of his law, the ſin by this object becometh infinitely hainous and hateful, though the fact and perſon be finite. 3. Thus for to preſerve and to have
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:53450:50"/>kept <hi>Adam</hi> in that life and felicity wherein he was firſt placed he had ſufficient ſtrength and righteouſneſs; but that could not recover and raiſe him up againe, nor nothing that was leſs then infinite. 4. What God required of us to keep us in favour and happineſs, was one thing, and <hi>Adam</hi> had ſufficiency to have given: but now the queſtion is, what God requireth of Chriſt for the making up of the breach, the appeaſing of his wrath, and the full ſatisfying of his minde and juſtice according to that Law of Mediatorſhip laid upon him, the righteouſneſs whereof he hath fulfilled <hi>per omnia.</hi> The firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> in all his perfections and abilities, could never have done the will of God as it is contained and required herein, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 40.78. 4. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, A better righteouſneſs was needful now, In that God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to reſtore, and raiſe his Elect unto a far more bleſſed ſtate then an earthly Paradiſe, even unto an havenly crown and kingdome, where they ſhall ſhine like the Sun in the firmament, and their bodies ſhall be, not natural, as was <hi>Adams,</hi> but ſpiritual, made like unto Chriſts glorious body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.44. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.21. therefore hath the Lord laid the infinite ſatisfaction and righteouſneſs of his Son for a foundation of ſo ſuperexcellent and glorious a ſtructure or edifice, <hi>John</hi> 17.22. <hi>The glory which thon gaveſt me, I have given them:</hi> and verſ. 24. <hi>Father, I will that they alſo whom thou haſt given me, be with me where I am, that they behold my glory which thou haſt given me.</hi> You, to finde out what righteouſneſs is needful, onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult with the moral Law, and imagine a condition attainable by Chriſt, which, you ſay, is onely in reſpect of certainty of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance made happier then <hi>Adams.</hi> You are peremptory, and Dictator-like in your aſſertions; and when you have put your ſelf-liking ſenſe upon the words of any Author, never intended by him, then you canonize him for Orthodox.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>M.</hi> B. <hi>But they never uſed ſuch expreſſions in the Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian ſenſe, as if hereby, we were made not only perfectly righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, but alſo holy, and without ſin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> When the Authors have the ſame expreſſions, and uſe the ſame words; yet, if you may be the Gloſſary, your ſiniſter mind can make their ſenſe to vary and differ. 2. They who ſay we are perſectly righteous, do affirme us to be holy alſo and without
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:53450:51"/>ſin in the ſame ſenſe and manner, but not inherently: for if the law require holineſs and righteouſneſs, how can we be juſtified in Chriſt, from what the Law hath againſt us, and yet not be as well holy as righteous in him. and ſo without ſin? what can be ſpoken by the Spirit of God more plainly then this, <hi>Chriſt hath loved us, and waſhed us from our ſins in his blood?</hi> Rev. 15. See alſo <hi>Col.</hi> 1.22. And read <hi>Luther</hi> on <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130. verſ. 3. who there ſaith. They that put not their truſt herein alone, that by the death of Chriſt their ſins are taken away, and Gods eyes cloſed, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee their ſins, muſt needs periſh; for this onely do the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures ſet forth, that our life reſteth wholly and alonely in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, and in that the Lord will not ſee our ſins, but in mercy cover them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the reading of which words, the ſaid Author of the <hi>Honey-comb</hi> was much convinced, and ſore terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and troubled, as he confeſſed. But your carnal reaſon can put a lower and ſtrange ſenſe upon all ſuch places, and ſo preſent them in your own ſhape, that nothing may offend any: beyond a carnal ſenſe, no truth can be admitted; what God ſpeaketh plainly, will be received no further, then wit conceiveth, and letteth us ſee how it may be true, and then we will ſay, we belive it; but that is not to give credit unto God, in what in his word he propoundeth, <hi>but to aſſent unto reaſon, as it comprehendeth.</hi>

If your ſpirits be grown ſo wanton and confident, by reaſon of ſome ſuppoſed parts or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities more eminent in your ſelf, that you will not keep tract of the Orthodox, but ſlight and reject all humane authority, as fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too ſhort of that height you aime at in your aſpiring thoughts, yet reaſon requireth it of you to ſhew your reader ſome clear text of Scripture, upon which you ground your diſtinction, and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. If the moral law ſtrictly and properly ſo called, was given as a covenant of grace, Why is it called a law of works, requiring mans righteouſneſs? And then <hi>Paul</hi> argued nothing ſolidly, when he ſaid, <hi>If it be of works, it is no more of grace: and if of grace, it is no more of works; elſe grace is no more grace.</hi> To admit the one, is to exclude and deny the other: ſo inconſiſtent they be in this point, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.6. But you take time to prove it, and you have your asking: and we wait your leiſure. In the interim, you preſent us with as uncouth and unwarrantable an aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>viz.</hi> that the word <hi>Law</hi> is taken for that which is meer man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dative,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:53450:52"/>without any promiſe at all, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It will prove as difficult, as bold an enterprize, to undertake the proof and defence of this. The Scriptures define the law in theſe words, <hi>Do, and live;</hi> and ſo implyeth the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> He that doth not ſhall dye: ſo that the mandative is not without the promiſe, nor threatning. When <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>They that are of the works of the law, are curſed,</hi> Gal. 3.10. doth he not argue convincingly, that the works of the law, which we do in obedience to its command, cannot be ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and ſet free from the curſe? And that the law is ever inveſted with divine authority to promiſe and threaten, to curſe and bleſs, to kill and give life? I ſhould be afraid ſo to limit the Lords So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty, and to deveſt him of ſo much power in his juſt and holy law, as to make him ſome petite and under-ruler or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, allowing him in his law onely a juriſdiction to make and impoſe a law, without a full and due reigning power; having no more light to clear it, then as yet you hold forth unto us. And now with this wittily-deviſed key, you can pick out, and give us the right ſenſe of all thoſe aſſertions which the learned have concerning the difference between the Law and the Goſpel; and putting your ſenſe into their words, can make them ſpeak as you pleaſe. But though you can ſhew us no text to aſcertaine the verity of any thing, yet you give us a reaſon, as weak and unſound as is your affirmation <hi>viz.</hi>

You may ſeem to diſparage the learned too much, as if, confining or aſcribing all the promiſes to the Goſpel, or accounting them to be Goſpel, they ſhould deny any promiſe to appertaine to the law.

Juſtifying faith is ſo called on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the object of it, unto which it hath reſpect;<note place="margin">Non aliunde nos ſalutem quam ex evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelio conſequi quoniam non a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libi ſuam nobis juſtitiam Deus patefacil, quae ſola nos ab in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teritu leberat. <hi>Calv.</hi>
                        </note> but this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is not propounded in the moral law, for the ſoul to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect unto: therefore it is an error to teach that juſtifying faith, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called, is required in the moral law, and a confounding of law and Goſpel. The righteouſneſs of God is the object of juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith (therefore it is called the righteouſneſs of faith alſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.6. and that in oppoſition to the righteouſneſs of the law. <hi>v.</hi> 5.) and it is only revealed in the Goſpel; whence <hi>Paul</hi> inferreth it to be the power of God to ſalvation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16, 17. and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is preached for the obedience of this faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.5. that is, to call and bring men unto this juſtifying faith: but if the law do it, it is not the proper office and end of the Goſpel. 3. What requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth repentance, muſt neceſſarily propound a promiſe of pardon and acceptance unto the penitent; but the moral law knoweth, nor offereth no ſuch mercy to any ſinner. 4. God cannot be rightly worſhipped, nor known, but in Chriſt the Mediator, by whom alone we have acceſs with boldneſs, and confidence,<note place="margin">Deus niſi in Chriſto ſuo coli nec cognoſci.</note> 
                        <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.12. but the law teacheth not Chriſt. 5. And if our Sacraments be commanded in the ſecond commandment, then they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Jews; for whatever the law requireth, it is of them that live under it, as did the Jews, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19. but I hope our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments were not commanded them to uſe; yea, and we by that
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53450:53"/>are to be circumciſed, who now have the ſecond comman dment? 2. If all the ceremonial law be commanded there, then the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial doth not differ in nature and kind from the moral, but as a part from the whole;<note place="margin">Where is the ſpecifical diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence then?</note> ſo that you have vainly diſtinguiſhed the law into moral ceremonial, and judicial: many other arguments might be uſed to let you ſee your great miſtake; but I forbear in a caſe ſo clear.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>M.</hi> B. <hi>The moral law hath more particulars, then can be in the law of nature; hence the Apoſtle ſaith, he had not known luſt to be ſin, had not the law ſaid ſo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> As the moral law is not ſo comprehenſive as to containe juſtifying faith and repentance, ſo neither do you evince it to be more extenſive or large then the law of nature, having more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars then be in that; theſe be your private crotchets. How will it ſtand with the juſtice of God, to require more then was given to our nature at firſt? And the invalidity of your reaſon is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; for though the Apoſtle had not known luſt by it, yet you know that much of that law lyeth dead and obſcure in us; there be many ſeeds and remanents of it, which to us be imperceivable, till the Miniſtery of the moral law do fetch thoſe ſparks from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the aſhes, revive, and bring them to light. And luſt lurketh in our corrupt nature, as fire is in the ſlint, not known, nor taken notice of, till the law, as the ſteel, beat it out, and cauſe it to ſparkle abroad; but it followeth not that the moral law containeth more, becauſe it revealeth more. 2. You take the natural law as it is obliterated, and imperfect in our corrupt nature, and the moral law in its perfection; an unequal compariſon. 3. The ſin of luſt was there before the law came; now if there were not a law of nature, or in nature, againſt which it was, how came it to be ſin? by what law had it a being? for the knowledge of it, you ſay, was only by the moral law.</p>
                     <p>As you paſs along, you are ever and anon, like a raſh and paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Schoolmaſter, laſhing your adverſaries without cauſe, accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them as guilty of crying down the law, preaching againſt it. reviling it <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the like aſperſions you caſt upon them; which argue and bewray too much gall and diſtemper in you; but ſuch paſſages I paſs over, being minded not to reply to every extravagant expreſſion, but only to give ſatisfaction in what is material.</p>

                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> And yet you ſaid but lately, that the law requireth juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying faith; to what end is it, if it ſhow no way to juſtification; nor cannot juſtifie, as you ſay afterward? or how can it then be a covenant of grace?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>M.</hi> B. <hi>God doth uſe the law as he doth his whole word, to beget and increaſe the life of grace in us — and in this effect of the law, to increaſe life,</hi> David <hi>doth often commend it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. There be two principal and eſſential parts of the Covenant of Grace. 1. To hold out the way of juſtification, peace, and life. 2. To promiſe and give the Spirit of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and renovation. So <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33, 34. and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25, 26. And the law doth neither of theſe: therefore it is no cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. There is nothing more againſt Scripture, and the maine cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of all true divinity, then to teach that the life of grace is begot by the law. Here are two great miſtakes: Firſt concerning the nature of the life of grace, which is not in works, nor the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of inherent holineſs or ſanctification; for to move and walk in the law of works, or of our own active righteouſneſs, is a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal life; but that is the life of grace which reviveth, quickeneth,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:53450:54"/>and comforteth the mortified,<note place="margin">Vita anima eſt ſentire gratiam Dei: mors animae eſt ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re iram Dei. <hi>Scult.</hi>
                        </note> dejected, and diſtreſſed conſcience, which lay in extreme wo, and in the ſhadow of death, being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of the ſentence of condemnation paſſed upon him by the law and the ſpirit of bondage. If you know not yet what this life is, and wherein it conſiſts, ask the condemned priſoner, whoſe life is gone by the law, and he will ſay, his pardon would be his life, which muſt come from the meer grace and mercy of his Prince. Your great reading may tell you that when divinity was more pure and diſtinct then it is now, repentance was ſaid to have two parts.<note place="margin">Juſtificat. vitae hoc eſt unde naſcitur vita. <hi>Piſc.</hi>
                        </note> 1. Mortification. 2. Viviſication; and the object of both theſe is the man, who is ſpiritually ſlain by the law, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. and again quickened through the faith of the operation of God, and ſo made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of the firſt reſurrection, <hi>Revel.</hi> 20.6. hence its ſaid, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.13.—<hi>You hath he quickened together with him, forgiving you all your treſpaſſes;</hi> and the efficient or worker of both theſe is God, who killeth and maketh alive; and man is the patient: the ſoul receiving the pardon of ſins, hath entrance into the preſence and favour alſo of God; and in his favour is life: and his loving kindneſs is better then life. In his preſence is fulneſs of joy, ſaith the Pſalmiſt. Hence we read, that juſtification is to life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. and Chriſt is the bread of life, whoever eateth of him, ſhall live for ever, <hi>John</hi> 6. and whoſoever heareth his voice, ſhall live, <hi>John</hi> 5.25. Thus life cometh by believing; but law is not of faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.21. If there had been a law that giveth life, ſurely righteouſneſs (which is our juſtification) ſhould have been by the law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.21. for righteouſneſs and life come both one way; but you confeſs our righteouſneſs cometh not in that way of the law; and ſo I hope, hereafter, you will ſay life cometh another way.</p>
                     <p>Here let me commend a ſentence or two unto your ſelf and the reſt of the brethren; yet for your ſakes I will not Engliſh them. <hi>Vos falſa imaginatione decipitis miſeros homines quaſi ex lege vivere debent eóque praetextu in lege ipſos detinetis, Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio interea facitis invidiam, quaſi in nihilum juſtitiam redi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat, quam ex lege habemus, atqui lex ipſa eſt quae nos ſibi mori cogit— Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>pulchre deſcribit Paulus, neminem legi vivere, niſi cui lex eſt mortua; hoc eſt, otioſa &amp; fine effectu, nam fimul atque lex in nobis vivere caepit, jem nobis infligere

                     <p>He that hath any Chriſtian experience, knoweth, that when the ſoul lyeth in death and darkneſs, the apprehenſion and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſt (who is received and cometh into the heart by faith) is the onely true light, life, peace, and conſolation of it. What that law is, <hi>David</hi> ſo commended to get life by, is to be known hereafter, together with your ſecond miſtake here, <hi>viz.</hi> that the law is the inſtrument to beget life, and to ſanctifie; for it is too irkſome and vain a thing to ſpeak to theſe every time you eaſt them in our way.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>M.</hi> B. p. 153. <hi>This is remarakble, that though the former tables were broken, yet now God enters into a covenant of grace with them, as appeareth by proclaiming him ſelf long-ſuffering, gracious: but yet God cauſeth the commandments to he writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten again for them: implying, that theſe may very well ſtand with the covenant of grace which oppoſeth the Antinomian.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> God entred into a covenant of grace with them, not now, but long before; ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.4, 7. <hi>As for me, behold my covenant is with thee, and thou ſhalt be a father of many na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> verſ. 7. <hi>And I will eſtabliſh my covenant between me and thee, and thy ſeed after thee, for an everlaſting cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy ſeed after thee.</hi> 2. Though God in great wiſdom gave the ten commandments to <hi>Abrahams</hi> poſterity for ſpecial ends and purpoſes (as now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo it is continued in the Church) yet it is not joyned to the covenant of grace, as if it ſhould perfect; or alter it, or adde any thing to it. It being intire of it ſelf, and diſtinct from the law; their natures, offices, ends, and effects ſo much differing one from the other. Read <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.15, 16, 17. A place full of light and ſatisfaction: <hi>Brethren, I ſpeak after the manner of men, though it be but a mans covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annulleth or addeth thereto:</hi> verſ. 16. <hi>Now to</hi> Abraham <hi>and his ſeed were the promiſes made,</hi> &amp;c. verſ. 17. <hi>And this I ſay, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Chriſt, the law which was four hundred and thirty yeers after cannot diſannul, that it ſhould make the promiſe of none effect.</hi> And note by the way, 1. How the covenant (or Teſtament, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>) and promiſe are both one with the Apoſtle, which you ſtumbled at elſwhere. 2. That there is not one word of truth, in what you ſay to oppoſe your adverſary: but the text is directly againſt your ſelf. 3. Where you ſay the law may ſtand with a covenant of grace, your own words imply, that it is not then a covenant of grace, as you formerly aſſerted.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>M.</hi> B. page 155. <hi>How neceſſary it is to have this law pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulged, if it were poſſible, as terribly in our congregations, as it was on mount</hi> Sinai! <hi>this would make the very Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians finde the power of the law, and to be afraid to reject it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If it were ſo neceſſary that the outward promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation or preaching of the law ſhould be ſo terrible as your wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom requireth, ſurely God would have it ſo: for he hath power to do it: but the ſpecial power and terror is inward and ſpiritual; God by his convincing ſpirit making the heart ſhake, and tremble in the conſcience of ſin, and a curſed periſhing condition: of this
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:53450:55"/>terrour and conſternation, your Antinomian may ſcon have much experience as you, yea more, for he findeth death in that miniſtration, by the reviving of ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9 10. and therefore is dead to it, as <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.19. but you ſay life cometh by the law, and ſo live by doing and working; an aſſured argument that you were never truely ſlain by the law. 2. Would you now have the law become ſo terrible in your congregations? why then did you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them that made it like a horrid Gorgon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you mean ſurely this terrour only for the Antinomians, not for others; you thunder againſt your adverſaries, but deal gently with friends. Alſo you daſh ſin out of countenance, which is well; but do not throw down mans righteouſneſs, but eſtabliſh it rather.</p>
                     <p>A little after you ſay, The Antinomian counteth ſin nothing, becauſe of juſtification. But in what ſenſe doth he ſo vilifie it? I dare affirme that none hateth ſin more, is ſo weary of it, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth ſo of its remaining and dwelling in the fleſh, and the ſorrow it ſometime breeds him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And yet if he make light of it, how can he prize juſtification from it? he that accounteth nothing of ſin, cannot rightly eſteem of a Saviour to ſave from it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore contrarily our counting all things loſs and dung, even our beſt works legal zeal, reformation, and worſhip, becauſe ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and defiled with the leproſie of ſin, for the excellent know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſake of Chriſt Jeſus, our deſire ever to be found in him, not having our own righteouſneſs, to know nothing but Chriſt cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do argue ſin to be our greateſt and moſt fearful evil to our apprehenſions; but it is not ſo with you, and your diſciples, who ſeldome or never preach or deſire to hear of a Saviour, of free juſtification; and do ſo wrangle with the doctrine of grace and faith. And laſtly, it is confeſſed that by faith in the blood of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and the grace of juſtification raigning in the conſcience, ſin, Satan, and hell, be conquered, defied, and triumphed over. Who can lay any thing to their charge? Thanks be to God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he that envyeth this in others, is to be pitied, becauſe of his poor condition. What account do you make of a debt you know is diſcharged? It troubleth you little in reference to danger by ſuite or law.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, That phraſe of Gods not ſeeing ſin in a believer is ſtill an eye-ſore to you and many other. And to add this to the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:53450:56"/>former. It argueth that you make nothing of ſin. For, 1. If you hated it, you would ſeek to get your ſoul cleanſed from it. 2. If you loved God, you would not come and appear in his ſight untill you were waſhed from it, ſeeing it is unto him ſo hateful and abominable, that he cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the ſight of it; and therefore calleth upon his people to waſh and make them clean, and then to come. Or yet, 3. If you feared God, and ſtood in true aw of him, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how terrible he and his preſence, is where he ſeeth and marketh iniquity (for who may abide it? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.3. or who then can ſtand?) you durſt not abide in his fight without that faith and aſſurance that the blood of his Son Jeſus hath waſhed and cleanſed you from all your ſinnes. If, as that Martyr ſaid, the vaile were taken off <hi>Moſes</hi> face, ſuch a glory and dreadful Majeſty would break forth, as would confound your ſpirits, and be intolerable, your ſins being ſet in the light of his countenance; then you would not deal with God without faith in the blood of Chriſt;<note place="margin">Extrae Chriſtum horrendum eſt, imo de Deo co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitare. <hi>Calv.</hi>
                        </note> nor durſt entertaine a thought of him out of Chriſt, in whom iniquity is done away, never to be remembred any more. Then you cry out, Oh bleſſed man, whoſe iniquities are for given, and whoſe ſin is covered, and ſo uſe your own words; ſay all that ever you preached or writ againſt this is falſe, you knew not what you ſaid. Thus a day of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and trouble may come, in which you all who have diſparaged and deſpiſed this, may be brought to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and embrace it, as an uſeful and moſt acceptable truth of God, full of ſoul-conſolation; which in your wretched ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity is now loathed and rejected; the law is ſo mitigated and modified in your opinion and Miniſtery, that <hi>Sinai</hi> is your <hi>Sion:</hi> you are not afraid to ſtand there.</p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> He is an Antinomian that doth ſo; but you cannot finde the adverſaries you deal with guilty of ſuch a crime; yet you are no fit advocate to patronize or defend the law, for it is abrogated by your ſelf, if that be true, as it is moſt certaine, that <hi>lex non damnans; non eſt lex,</hi> a law without power to condemn is no law: for the law you would eſtabliſh hath no condemning power, as you ſay; therefore the law is by you abrogated. How fully ſatisfactory is <hi>Luther</hi> to any reaſonable man! <hi>Non quod lex pereat, imo manet vivit &amp; regnat in impiis: ſed pius eſt legi mortuus ſicut &amp; peccato, diabolo, Inferno mortuus eſt, quae tamen manent, &amp; mundus ac impii ea habebunt. Ideo cum Sophiſtae intelligunt legem abrogari — tu intellige paulum &amp; quemlibet Chriſtianum univerſae legi abrogari, &amp; mori, &amp; tamen legem manere.</hi> Sophiſters do underſtand and take the law to be abrogated; but the truth is, the Chriſtian is abrogated and dead to it; and yet the law remaineth entire. Henceforth correct your ſelf, and ceaſe to ſlander, or miſtake your poor bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and without cauſe ſo to embitter your words with gall and ſervour of ſpirit: and the Lord forgive you.</p>
                     <p>What further is ſpoken in this Sermon againſt the Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, is either chargeable upon <hi>Iſlebius,</hi> or ſome other not known to me: or, 2. Is grounded upon a meer miſtake of our tenets, or is anſwered elſewhere; ſo that, to avoide prolixity, I meddle with no more.</p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Did not Chriſt taxe and reprove the Phariſees for their alms, prayers, ſacrifices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which were things commanded in the law, becauſe they wanted pureneſs of love, and did them in hypocriſie, for praiſe and ſelf-ends? 2. It is the chief point of wiſdom in the teacher, to diſcover want of truth, of affection and love to things done according to the outward precept of the law. 3. Whoſo doth a thing ſimply, being moved thereunto by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the law, doth it not in love. 4. Though the law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire love in every duty, yet it both findes us in enmity, and yet it cannot breed nor work love in the heart, though it be often preſſed to be done, where no ſuch affection is found, nor once ſpoken of: thus moſt are ſuffered to bleſs themſelves in that kinde of doing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>M.</hi> B. <hi>Yea, we are to love God by the law, becauſe he hath given Chriſt for us: for the law commandeth to love God for whatever benefit he beſtoweth upon us.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> If God command love by the law, becauſe he hath given Chriſt, then you muſt preſuppoſe that Chriſt was given be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:53450:57"/>promiſe to give him in future, it had been more probable: for the promiſe of the Meſſiah was before the giving of the Law. 2. But neither you, nor I (if we underſtand what love in truth is) can love God becauſe the law requireth it, though that be a reaſon alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and uſed for it; for it is his love ſhed abroad into the heart that cauſeth love in us: <hi>We love him, becauſe he loved us firſt.</hi> Natural enmity (whatever we profeſs otherwiſe) cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed and aboliſhed, but by faith, which purifieth the heart, and worketh by love.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>M.</hi> B. <hi>God doth work grace in us by this (the law) as well as by the Goſpel— God doth uſe the law inſtrumentally, for to quicken up grace, and increaſe it in us, as</hi> Pſal. 1 19. ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>

                     <p>M.B. <hi>This therefore is the aſſertion which an Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Author maintaineth,</hi> viz. <hi>that the law is not an inſtrument of true ſanctification; and that the promiſe of the Goſpel is the ſeed or doctrine of the new birth; and it may not be denied, but that many ſpeeches might fall from ſome men, which might ſeem to comply with that opinion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here is ſtrange inſolency and loftineſs of ſpirit. All mens eyes muſt be put out, but yours, or theirs who ſee as you ſee: you pretend learning and reading; but how is the judgement of the learned ſlighted and contemned by you? you ſtand up as a zealous advocate pleading for the Law; but what illegality and injuſtice is this? with what ſcorn and lordlineſs do you inſult o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver your Adverſary? and would bear, and beat down him, the truth, and his innocency, under the foot of pride and diſdain. Your ſingle opinion muſt be preferred before all, and received by all: in your conceit it carrieth in it the light of the Sun: here is the Popes ſpirit, all erre but he: all is Goſpel that comes from him: his word is a law; onely his Chair is wanting. But what mean the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident and Fellows of <hi>Sion</hi>-Colledge to do in the end, who ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and applaud this man, and his Book? Intend they hereby to bring in and eſtabliſh a piece of new and ſtrange divinity, and to reject and overthrow what is old and true?</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>It may not be denyed</hi> ſay you.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> But if it might, then perhaps it would be denyed; but there is that convincing power in the light of ſimple truth, that will force even the moſt impudent ſomewhat to yeeld.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Yet ſee what mincing he uſeth, and how loth he is to grant the whole truth, and that the world ſhould know that his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary hath any of the learned Orthodox truly and really for him, or that he himſelf oppoſeth any in this but a vilified and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed Antinomian. Many ſpeeches might fall, ſaith he, from ſome men; as if they were half a ſleep, or not ſo conſiderate as he is, when they let ſuch ſpeeches fall: or at leaſt intended no ſuch thing, or not in our ſenſe, as he often ſaith; for it is in him to put what ſenſe or gloſs he pleaſeth upon their words, that ſo they may not be for us, whenas the ſame truth, yea <hi>totidem, &amp; ipſiſſimis verbis,</hi> is aſſerted by both.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>From ſome men.</hi> And are they not men of leaſt worth and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:53450:58"/>account too in the Church? I dare ſay you do think no better of them for it. They are but ſome then: perhaps you mean few; and yet I think you can hardly name one learned and ſound Author, from whoſe pen the ſame aſſertion hath not fallen.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Might ſeem to comply with that opinion. Multa viden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, quae non ſunt.</hi> What do they ſeemingly accord with us, but in truth and reality are all for you, or as you will have them? who have learned to make <hi>quidlibet ex quolibet:</hi> yet why do you not produce one for you? becauſe you ſcarce can do it.</p>
                     <p>Reader, If thou haſt the Aſſertion of grace, and wouldſt turn to page 166. and 170. thou maiſt find there <hi>Auguſtine, Luther, Calvin, Bullinger, Cornerus Perkins, Cudworth, Brentius, Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator, Fox, Tindal,</hi> and <hi>Rollock:</hi> unto which it is eaſie to add as many more Orthodox all punctual and full to the point affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what I ſay; and their words are direct, full, and excluſive, denying this power and work to the law: wherefore I am not the firſt deviſer or broacher thereof, nor alone in this opinion, as walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in an unbeaten path. But unto me it is moſt ſtrange, that M. <hi>B.</hi> ſhould be ſo ſelf-confident, and bold of ſpirit, as to preſume to carry it with violence againſt all others. Let me commend unto thee the words of <hi>Perkins,</hi> becauſe he is worthily approved of, and beſt known unto the ſimple ſort, upon <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.2. Here, ſaith he, we ſee the difference between the Law and the Goſpel: the law doth not miniſter the Spirit unto us, for it onely ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our diſeaſe. and giveth us no remedy; the Goſpel mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtereth the Spirit. And upon <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.19. Evangelical ſorrow is ſorrow for ſin, becauſe it is ſin, this indeed is the grace of God; but it is not wrought by the law, but by the preaching of mercy and reconciliation <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Law then being the cauſe of no good thing in us. And <hi>Cudworth</hi> on <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.2. in the laſt difference between Law and Goſpel, hath theſe words, <hi>The law is no inſtrumental cauſe of faith, repentance or any ſaving grace.</hi> Is this now but <hi>ſeemingly</hi> to comply with our opinion, when they ſay the law is no inſtrumental cauſe of faith, repentance, nor of any ſaving grace, nor yet of any good thing in us? and ſtill theſe Authors were no Antinomians, but we muſt be ſo, becauſe our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, like thoſe of <hi>Stephen, Act.</hi> 7. do rule, and will have it ſo. I tremble to conſider the woful conſequences, if the Eccleſiaſtical
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:53450:59"/>power ſhould be once in their hands: but I truſt God will not ſuffer the wiſe and honourable Parliament ſo to intruſt them. But let us liſten what his conceit is.</p>
                     <p>M. B. <hi>I ſhall now labour to maintain the poſitive part, that the law preached may be bleſſed by God inſtrumentally to work the converſion of men.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An.</hi> The queſtion is not of Gods power whether he may or can do it, but whether he hath done it: let it appear in all the New Teſtament, that any one was converted, but by the Goſpel: Nay <hi>Paul,</hi> and Prieſts, with others, who had been zealous in the way of the law, were then onely converted when they received the Goſpel, and become obedient to the faith, <hi>Act.</hi> 6.7. or did God ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal it, that his will is to convert by the law? God can or may make heavy mountains to aſcend as high as the Sun, and there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide; and the waters in the Sea to burn like ſtraw or other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible matter: but he never did ſo as yet. If you ſhew it to be his will, we ſhall queſtion it no further.</p>
                     <p>M. B. <hi>And it is neceſſary to make this good.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe you have undertaken it, and are reſolved to oppoſe the apparent and generally received truth: to be contrary to all the Orthodox: to gratifie <hi>Sion.</hi> Colledge: to get a name to your ſelf, of being a knowing man, ſeeing more then all other learned Divines: or at leaſt, to maintain your owne credit, now it is neceſſary for you.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>M.</hi> B. <hi>For were the contrary true, it would be a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters duty in great part to lay aſide the preaching of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law, as not inſtrumental and ſubſervient to that maine end of the miniſtry, which is the converſion of ſouls.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> If I take your words in their true ſenſe, they argue, 1. (I am ſorry to ſpeak it) that M. <hi>B.</hi> knoweth not what converſion of the ſoul is: but this may be tryed by and by. 2. That he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, when he preacheth, to convert people by the Law, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the Spirit ſhould make it effectual for that purpoſe: and however he putteth in, <hi>or ſubſervient to that main end,</hi> yet he meaneth not onely preparatorily, for that he ſaith he cannot yeeld unto (which yet is the clear judgement, and conſtant and ſound doctrine of all true Divines) but he will be ſingular. But ſee his ground, and how ſandie, uncertain, and weak it is, to lay and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:53450:59"/>erect an edifice of ſo great conſequence upon it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>M.</hi> B. <hi>I ſuppoſe that Jeſus Chriſt hath obtained of God by his death, that ſuch efficacy and vertue ſhould go forth in the Miniſtery, that whether it be by Law or Goſpel he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, the ſouls of men may be healed and converted thereupon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> And muſt your meer ſuppoſition ſatisfie us in a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie (ſo newly, needleſly, and yet dangerouſly ſtarted up, to the great offence and diſturbance of the Church) of this nature, and high concernment? you may ſuppoſe, Chriſt hath redeemed all, men and Devils. A Papiſt ſuppoſeth that Chriſt by his death hath obtained that his Alms-deeds, Penance, and good works ſhould have a meritorious vertue and efficacy in them for pardon and ſalvation: and upon that deceitful foundation or ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the ſilly deluded wretch buildeth and hazardeth his everlaſting ſalvation. Oh that any ſhould be ſo ſimple and unwiſe, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent himſelf with an <hi>I ſuppoſed it is ſo.</hi> 2. You ſay, whether it be by law or Goſpel; ſo, as if God and Chriſt are indifferent, and it is left to mans choice to uſe either, as he liketh, for converſion: that is more liberty then is allowed you.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>That the ſouls may be healed and converted.</hi> The right order is, firſt to be converted, then healed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.15. But let this paſs; yet it is requiſite that we agree about the terms (for ſome doubts or differences may ariſe from the ambiguity of the words) yet not as if I would yeeld that regeneration, conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or healing (of which I ſee you make no difference) in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Scripture-acceptation, are wrought inſtrumentally by the law; but to help the weak reader, and to clear the truth every way.</p>
                     <p>And firſt: Regeneration is the begetting again of the ſoul to God, which God doth freely of his owne accord by the word of truth, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.18. but becauſe this will not be current, that this is meant of the Goſpel onely (as is objected, and as is to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed more fully in the next Lecture) in that the law is alſo called the word of truth; Let me therefore add two pregnant Texts, to put this out of all doubt, that it is to be underſtood of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel excluſively. The firſt is <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13. <hi>In whom you alſo, after you heard the word of truth, the Goſpel of your ſalvation:</hi> by which <hi>Paul</hi> telleth, how the <hi>Epheſians</hi> came to their faith and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:53450:60"/>hope in Chriſt, namely by the preaching of the Goſpel. So ſaith <hi>Calvin,</hi> He adorneth the Goſpel with two Epithets, in that he calls it <hi>the word of truth,</hi> and in that it is the <hi>inſtrument of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;</hi> which two adjuncts, ſaith he, are diligently to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.—And the Goſpel is not onely a certain truth, which cannot deceive (for ſo is the Law) but <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> he calls the word of truth, as if properly no truth were without it: and the vertue and efficacy of it is ſuch, that it bringeth ſalvation unto us, as it is alſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. <hi>The Goſpel is the power of God to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> &amp;c. and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> was not aſhamed, nor afraid to preach it at <hi>Rome</hi> alſo. If the Law would have ſerved, and <hi>Paul</hi> had known alſo this your liberty, and choſe to uſe either law or Goſpel, he needed not to ſhun, nor ſhrinke in the preaching of it, for every mans heart is principled to approve and receive that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine having the ſeeds and effect of the law naturally in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; but the Goſpel is ſupernatural, and the ſoul is indiſpoſed to receive it of it ſelf, yea and ſtrongly by aſſed and inclined againſt that way of peace and life revealed by it; for it maketh void, rejecteth, and caſteth downe all the excellencies of man, his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, ſtrength, righteouſneſs, wiſdome, goodneſs, as being vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, folly weakneſs, ſin, and vile with God; ſo to prepare and make way in the ſoul to bring in and commend Gods grace to be all-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient and that Chriſt alone may be exalted and rejoyced in. Hence the myſtery of the Goſpel was to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> fooliſhneſs, and to the <hi>Iew</hi> a ſtumbling-block. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23.</p>
                     <p>Alſo it is more then evident, that this word of the Goſpel was the inſtrument of converting all thoſe Churches to whom <hi>Paul</hi> writ, as his Epiſtles do teſtifie; as beſides theſe mentioned places to the <hi>Romans Corinthians,</hi> and <hi>Epheſians</hi> you may alſo ſee in <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.6.8.9. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.5. who were called into the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of the Goſpel. But what need the lighting of a Candle at noon-day, unleſs it be ſtill dark Saturday with us. The ſecond remarkable place is 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23, 25. <hi>Being born again, not of corruptible ſeed, but incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever:</hi> and verſ. 25. he expounds himſelf, ſaying. <hi>And this is the word which by the Goſpel is preached unto you.</hi> If need were, a cloud of expoſitors might be here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to evince and confirm it, that this inſtrumental word of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:53450:60"/>is not the Law, but the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>It is true, ſome tell us of a twofold regeneration, or rather a twofold ſenſe of the word; by the one, the ſoul cometh to a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond new being: and by the other, it hath the image of God rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtamped on it; And of a regeneration of Faith, and another of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of nature and life; but I would trouble none with theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions: yet this I add, that <hi>Melancthon</hi> upon <hi>Iohn,</hi> obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that Chriſt calleth our juſtification, regeneration; and indeed it is a new creation, and the putting of the ſoul into a new and happy condition, for thereby it hath reconciliation and peace with God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And there is a twofold healing. 1. Of our ſpiritual eſtates: and thus we are ſaid to be healed by the ſtripes of Chriſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.5. who is the repairer of this breach: and as for that wound of conſcience (in that day when ſin doth bite and ſting, and the law accuſe and terrifie) none other plaiſter can cure it, but the blood of Chriſt, who by his eternal ſpirit offered himſelf to purge and purifie the conſcience, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. and this is done by the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of faith; for health or ſalvation is onely in Chriſt, and in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe you can name: <hi>And as Moſes lifted up the Serpent, ſo muſt the Son of man be lifted up, that whoſoever believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in him might not periſh, but have everlaſting life</hi> John 3.14 15. 2. There is an inchoate and partial healing of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, hearts and lives, which is effected by the Spirit of Chriſt, renewing and changing all and every member of his my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical body, whereof he is the head: but as the Moral Law is not the inſtrument to reveal and hold forth Chriſt crucified; ſo Faith, by which the ſoul comes to be ſenſibly healed, and having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Chriſt to receive vertue from him, this Faith is onely inſtrumentally by the Goſpel, which is preached to all for the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.25, 26. <hi>And if our inheritance come by the law (in part or in whole) then Faith is made void, and the promiſe made of no effect,</hi> Rom. 4.14.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. And laſtly, Converſion may be taken, 1. for the change of the condition, as when who was in bondage is enlarged, ſet free, delivered out of the hands of his enemies: and of far off, is made near, as <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.36. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.21. or 2. for the turning of the heart to God, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18. <hi>To turn them from Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:53450:61"/>to God. If thou wilt return, return unto me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. For the change and alteration in the ſoul, when God ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth a man throughout, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. A man may change his religion, as did the Jewiſh-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes: and his outward way and manner of life, being refined and reformed according to the letter of the law, as the Phariſee, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.</p>
                     <p>Now to apply all. Hence I infer, and ſay, that it is never read in the Scripture, that the ſoul was made ſpiritually free, and eſtated in grace and favour, by the preaching of the Moral Law: but the office of it is to arreſt, convince, ſhut up the ſoul under ſin, the curſe, and condemnation, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.22. the law and the Goſpel are the two keys that Chriſt gave, that by the one, ſinners might be ſhut and bound; and by the other, ſet free, and brought forth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.18.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Neither did the Law inſtrumentally convert and turn the heart to God: for Chriſt is the way to the Father; his blood and croſs ſlayeth the enmity that is between divine juſtice and the ſinner, and removeth all lets whatever did hinder or ſeparate, and ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth a free way for acceſs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19, 20. and his righteouſneſs is the <hi>melius terminus,</hi> bond or mean of union between God and the ſoul, bringing them into a ſure and everlaſting covenant of peace: he is firſt King of righteouſneſs, and after that King of <hi>Salem,</hi> that is, of peace <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.2. Now Chriſt, his death and reſurrection, with the fruits and benefits thereof, are the ſubject and peculiar treaſures of the Goſpel, whereof <hi>Paul</hi> was made a Miniſter, that he might preach among the <hi>Gentiles</hi> the unſearcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble riches of Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.7, 9. further God cannot be com'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, known, nor enjoyed, <hi>niſi in Chriſto ſuo,</hi> but in Chriſt. And he gaineth and draweth the ſoul with cords of love: he appears gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and merciful to poor ſinners beaten downe, humbled, and brought to deaths door in the conſcience of ſin; elſe the ſoul being afraid of him, would with <hi>Adam</hi> flee away, and hide it ſelf from him: hence <hi>paſſim,</hi> men are exhorted to turne to the Lord, becauſe he is gratious and merciful, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.13. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86.5. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.12. We are to hold forth God in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf, and not imputing their ſins unto them: and as Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours for Chriſt, we pray men in Chriſts ſtead to be reconciled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:53450:61"/>to God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18, 20. Now this cannot be by the miniſtery of the Law, by which cometh the knowledge of ſin, for it worketh wrath, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.15. threatneth with the curſe and death, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. And thus the Law doth by the will and appointment of God, to force man out of himſelf, to deſtroy all ſelf-confidence, and truſt in any goodneſs of his owne, and to make him to ſeek out, and to hearken after Chriſt, the true and onely right door ſet open in the Goſpel: that by him the ſoul may have entrance, being found in him, not having its owne righteouſneſs which is of the Law, but that which is through faith in Chriſt, <hi>The righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which is of God by faith,</hi> Phil. 3.9. It is a vain, and a ſtrange conceit, that the ſoul ſhould convert to God by the preaching of the Law, ſith it can onely turne and come unto him by faith, which nothing doth ſo much croſs and hinder as the Law: and it putteth the ſoul upon a contrary way.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But if by converſion you mean (as happily you do) the change of the diſpoſition and frame of the ſoul: It is as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain alſo, and clear, that God doth not this by the law, but by Goſpel: thus <hi>Act.</hi> 15.9. God purifieth the heart by faith: and <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. they ſanctified by faith. This is the ſpecial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation that <hi>Paul</hi> giveth of the Goſpel, that therein we all with open face behold the glory of the Lord, as in a glaſs, and are changed into the ſame image from glory to glory even by the Spirit of the Lord.</p>
                     <p>Againe, can mans nature be changed till he be united and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted into Chriſt the true vine? and doth not vertue come by that inſition or union? And was it ever taught, or read, that the law ſhould be that miniſtery by which this is wrought? If the law do not ſet this object Chriſt before the ſoul, nor is no mean to bring and joyn it to him; how can it be an inſtrument to give and communicate the Spirit of Chriſt? Indeed, a legal ſpirit or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er it hath, which hath been effectual to work a great deal of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and legal ſtrictneſs, having a ſpecious and deceitful ſhew and luſtre, as we ſee in the Phariſees, who therefore were admired in their age. O Sir, if you would ſet before your own, and the eyes of your people, duely and daily, that exceeding kindneſs of God, and ſweetneſs of his ſo ſurpaſſing love in Chriſt in ſo infinite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of it, and ſeek to affect both your own and their hearts
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:53450:62"/>with it; you would finde what an incredible force and vertue is in it, far beyond any power in a legal Miniſtery, to melt, gaine, and leaven the ſoul, transforming it into its own nature and image, which is love and mercy; and ſo diſpoſing you to do all things of the law freely and willingly, which are but the offices and duties of love. And the law was given not to beget this love, but that by requiring it of us, either love or enmity as, it is in us, might be bewrayed, and made manifeſt. In a word, no ſounder, further, nor better converſion can be wrought by the law, then was in <hi>Paul,</hi> before he received the Faith; who in that his zeal of God was a blood-ſucker and butcher of Chriſtians, Chriſts ſilly and harmleſs ſheep; for he was inwardly in the gall of bitterneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo are too many this day, as we ſee, finde, and feel, who might be metamorphozed by the Goſpel, and of wolves become lambs; like Prieſt, like People, according to their paſture they feed in, <hi>viz.</hi> as the nature of the doctrine is they receive, ſo they are: where much law is, there hardneſs of heart, cruelty, ſelf-love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but want of meekneſs, humbleneſs, and mercy. And it will ever be true, that a legal zeal is perſecuting.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. If laſtly, you hold this laſt ſort of converſion to be by the law, <hi>viz.</hi> to make a looſe and profane man ſtrict and religious in his courſe of life (which is properly no ſouls converſion; for both he may be in <hi>ſtatu quo prius,</hi> no changling in his ſtate, and his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was principled for this way) this may be granted you: but alas who ſeeth not that this is hypocritical, feigned &amp; unſound. <hi>Luther</hi> ſaith, <hi>The law can but make hypocrites, if there be no further work but what is by it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This I ingenuouſly profeſs (what ever you may think of it) that my deſire is not to know or think of God out of Chriſt, but to confine all the powers and workings of my ſoul unto that ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and amiable object, God reconciled in his Son. And ſo to ſet him before me gracious, propitious, loving, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in all the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, occurences, and conditions of this life. And this is the true and onely office and exerciſe of faith. And thus I deal with God, even as he alſo dealeth with me, (according to <hi>Luthers</hi> expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) without the Law, in his Covenant of meer grace; the more I can do ſo, the greater confidence I have towards him, the better every thing he doeth pleaſeth me; the more welcome is the Croſs,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:53450:62"/>and the more apt and able I am to bear and digeſt it, the more is my heart and affections lively and ſweetly ſtirred up, and enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to love God, and to delight my ſelf in him: by this mean the ſoul is made merry and kept joyful in the Lord, and like an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument in good tune, it is ready for uſe upon any occaſion. And the inward appearing and manifeſtation of God unto the ſoul in love and tender mercy, doth melt it, and effectually change and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome the enmity and maliciouſneſs of my naughty heart and nature. And this light I endeavour to hold out to all, and to walk in this way of loving kindneſs, long-ſuffering, and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion towards every one, in doctrine and life, holding it the wiſeſt, moſt direct, effectual; and Goſpel-like courſe and way, thus to overcome the frowardneſs and evil that is in man, with lenity and goodneſs, even as God in this way prevented and overcame me. The more I can look into that gentleneſs, aimableneſs, and thoſe fatherly affections in God through Chriſt Jeſus towards me, and that ſecreet boſome of divine love is ſo laid open; the more are all fears baniſhed, diſcontentments ſwallowed up, and I am heartned to go on chearfully in a Chriſtian courſe, as beſt becometh that holy and heavenly calling. And the more abundantly Gods thoughts of peace are diſcovered unto me, the more peace and reſt I thereby finde bred and preſerved in my thoughts. You may account it a licentious doctrine, or otherwiſe aſperſe it with indignities, becauſe you have little skill of it: and may bridle your ſelf and diſciples by another mean and kinde of woful do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; but when you have done, I wiſh you might feel how your owne pulſes do beat. But I proceed.</p>
                     <p>You deny the Law to work onely preparatorily in converſion. And I thinke he never had experience of conveſion, that is of your mind; you would make men believe you ſit downe with a legal reformation (as is the caſe of too many) inſtead of a Goſpels-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion: or that the law had never as yet its due and perfect work upon you, for then you would ſing another ſong: <hi>When the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment came ſin revived and I dyed,</hi> Rom. 7. Did ever any come to life, but by death? And when a man hath ſeen and felt nothing but ſin and death in himſelf, the law cannot tell him, nor let him know of a righteouſneſs and life ordained for him in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of himſelf; and therefore here it ceaſeth to help. He that
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:53450:63"/>expecteth converſion by the Law, may as well ſeek light in darkneſs, life in death, converſion where confuſion, terrour, and deſperation is. Who can credit your bare word in this, that the law, which is found both by Scripture and experience to be the word that revealeth and worketh wrath and death, ſhould yet be the miniſtry alſo of converſion to the ſoul? I cannot do it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>M.</hi> B. <hi>Onely two things muſt be premiſed.</hi>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> You mean not, that the Goſpel-promiſe ſhould be any ingredient to the miniſtry of the law, and ſo by the vertue and efficacy of this (as ſome ſpecial pearl uſed amongſt other things, in themſelves of little or no force) this cure or work ſhould be effected: but you ſay that vertue ſhould go forth equally and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently by law or Goſpel; and this becauſe God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to give a new heart through Chriſt as the Medium, by and in whom he creates and changes it anew; for ſo you would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict your ſelf: but thus you intend, that Gods promiſe to give this heart is grounded on Chriſt, as the reaſon of making it; but the performance may be by the law. But is it your part to make this to appear for truth? By regeneration we are become children to God; but if this be by the law, then are we but like <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael,</hi> children of the bond-woman. Well, your words want weight and credit too. I wonder you ſhould think ſuch private fancies would ever be received, having no warrant but your pen.

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Subſerviency was alway granted and taught; but that may be without mixture. Chriſt, or the Goſpel and the Law, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be and dwell together: and as the dead fly marreth the Ointment in the box, ſo the leaſt thing of the law mingled with the Goſpel, corrupteth it, and wholly deſtroyeth it, ſaith <hi>Luther;</hi> they are ſo repugnant and oppoſite; you know the nature and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of contraries, and the doctrine of grace and of works are contrary: <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. <hi>If of grace, it is no more of works.</hi>

                        </note> The learned have taught and told us, that the whole paſſage and way from ſin, wrath, and death, unto righteouſneſs, favour, and life, is by mean of free juſtification. What is bleſt to juſtifie, is bleſt to convert us to God: but the Goſpel, and not the Law you grant, is bleſt to Juſtification, Adoption, Conſolation. When <hi>Paul</hi> did beſeech the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to be reconciled to God,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.19, 20</note> 
                        <hi>or to receive the Atonement,</hi> was not that to turn to God? no, God had the heart: to eſchew evil and do good, is not to turne unto God. <hi>My ſon, give me thy heart,</hi> and then <hi>let thy eyes obſerve my wayes.</hi> Chriſt is the way to God. Again, is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to partake of Adoption, whereby we become children, by one doctrine, and to receive the qualification, or divine image or like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs reinſtambed on us, by another doctrine? 3. Is not our Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, or coverſion, the ground of our hope and conſolation? The promiſe of the Goſpel giveth no ground of hope or conſolation to the unconverted, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. <hi>We are begotten again to a lively hope.</hi> Who can have hope in God, or conſolation from him, but he that is regenerated, or converted? or is there any ground, or reaſon of either, but onely in this, that we are called and converted to the faith of the Goſpel? <hi>Bleſſed be God, who hath given us everlaſting conſolation, and good hope through grace,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2.16. You put in after, Not in any thing he doth, as if you made no difference between converſion, and mans doing, or work; which is groſs.

                        <hi>M.</hi> B. <hi>And this muſt needs be the opinion of all ſound Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, whatſoever may fall from them at other times; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by their common anſwer to the Papiſts queſtion; If the Law and the commands thereof be impoſſible, to what purpoſe then doth he command them? Then we anſwer, That thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands are not onely informing of a duty but they are practical and operative means appointed by God to work at leaſt in ſome degree, that which is commanded.</hi>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> You know, they do not plainly and profeſſedly ſay, this is their opinion; and therefore without alledging one ſentence out of any directly to ſecond this of yours, you labour to derive and infer it as buſily as you may; ſuch poor ſhifts are you put unto. 2. Neither is it the opinion of all, for thoſe are as ſound whoſe anſwer is, That the law doth therefore command things now impoſſible, that we may ſee our great loſs by the fall, with our preſent diſability, that ſo we may be humbled a viled and confounded in our ſelves. 3. To incline and diſpoſe the ſoul to look into the Goſpel-way, in which all cometh, as to beggers, by faith and prayer: Therefore <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſaith, God commandeth things impoſſible, not as you ſay, that in commanding he may give power, but that we thereby feeling our owne utter inſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, may be occaſioned to turn precepts into prayers, ſaying, <hi>Da quod jubes.</hi> God bids us turn, not thereby to enable us, but that finding thereby both the neceſſity of it, and alſo our inability, we may cry, <hi>Turn thou us and we ſhall be turned.</hi> Thus we ſee whoſe hand worketh the will and deed.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. You alſo ſtill mince the matter, ſaying, <hi>At leaſt in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree:</hi> you love to play at ſmall games, rather then ſit out: you are uncertain, not reſolved as yet what to affirm and ſtick unto, this being a fiction of your owne, and no Scripture or Author can be produced to confirm or countenance it.</p>
                     <p>It was never queſtioned, but what is wrought by the miniſtry of the word, is to be attributed to the Spirit, as the principal effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent: and other paſſages (of which he ſtill giveth ſome verbal touch)
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:53450:65"/>being already cleared, I now proceed to his Arguments.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>M.</hi> B. <hi>I bring theſe Arguments to prove the Law, and preaching of it, the means of Converſion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>That which is attributed to the whole word of God, as it is Gods word, ought not to be denyed to any part of it: Now this is made the propertie of the whole word of God, to be the inſtrument of converſion,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.16.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Your propoſition is unſound, and will not be granted: many things are often attributed to the word in general, which canot be affirmed of every part of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4. <hi>Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever things are written, were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the Scripture might have hope;</hi> that is, ſaith <hi>Piſcator, through patience ariſing from the comfort of the Scripture,</hi> viz. that be written aforetime. Now in the ſecond premiſe, <hi>page</hi> 188. you tell us, that however the law may be bleſt to converſion, yet it cannot be the ground of our juſtification, adoption, and conſolation: nor a man cannot have hope, nor comfort in whatever he doth, but it muſt be the promiſe onely of the Goſpel. See how your ſelf will not have righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, comfort, and hope from every part of the word, no from no part of the law, but do reſtrain it to the Goſpel onely, and yet the greateſt part of what was then written was law. 2. Your Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption is denyed alſo, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is the property of the whole word to be the inſtrument of converſion. And your place 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. will not conclude it. For firſt, the Apoſtle ſpeaketh not there of converſion, but of converſation, manners and life, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If all Scripture were to reprove, correct; then none is to comfort; but one part is to reprove, and another for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, a third for doctrine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> law is to kill, and Goſpel to make alive; what part is for one effect and purpoſe, hath not formally any partial ability or fitneſs for another; let the eye ſee, the tongue ſpeak, and the feet walk, as being purpoſely made and fitted for their proper offices. The whole Scripture is as a promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary or full Treaſury, out of which may be drawne and taken what is needful for faith and manners: but what is for manners, will be unaptly uſed to build up in the faith. Alſo <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. the word compared to the ſeed, is verſ. 19. called by Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:53450:65"/>the word of the kingdom, or note of diſtinction: and by it is meant the Goſpel, as all know. Laſtly, for that place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. let <hi>Piſcator</hi> ſatisfie you if the context will not ſerve you: he ſaith it is <hi>Sermo Evangelii,</hi> the word of the Goſpel, which is effectual to pierce the heart, and convince the minde of the truth of the heavenly doctrine in it: ſo that none can with a quiet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience derogate from the credit or verity of it. And he addeth, that <hi>uſitatiſſimum eſt, &amp;c.</hi> It is a very uſual thing with <hi>Paul,</hi> by the word of God in general, to mean the word of the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>M.</hi> B. 2. <hi>Argument is taken from thoſe places where the law is expreſly named to be inſtrumental in this great work; not to name that place</hi> Rom. 7.14. <hi>where the law is called</hi> ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual <hi>in that reſpect, as well as in others, becauſe it is that which worketh ſpiritually in us: as</hi> Paul <hi>was carnal, becauſe he wrought carnally.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Indeed that place might well have been ſpared in this controverſie: for you finde nothing in it for your turne. It is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſpiritual, becauſe of the ſpiritual nature of it, in oppoſition to <hi>Pauls,</hi> which was carnal; and becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> was carnal, therefore he wrought carnally; but his working carnally, did not make him carnal. Alſo the law is called ſpiritual, becauſe of its ſpiritual diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering and convincing power or efficacy; but not becauſe of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſpiritual change it wrought upon <hi>Paul,</hi> as the whole context and every circumſtance there maketh it plain: the law let him ſee the vitiouſneſs of his nature, what repugnancy and contrariety was in him to that purity, holineſs, and perfection held forth in the law; and ſo occaſionally, by the commandment, ſin became ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſinful, verſ. 13.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>M.</hi> B. <hi>The places are clear out of</hi> Pſalm 119. <hi>and</hi> Pſal. 19.7. <hi>The Law of God is perfect, converting the ſoul. That which the Antinomian objecteth, is, that the Hebrew word doth ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie largely any doctrine, and ſo may comprehend the whole word of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> You ſay, that others, as well as they <hi>Antinomian,</hi> take the law ſo largely; ſo that you ſee your Adverſarie is not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle in his opinion, as you are, who can produce no Author: but onely ſay, <hi>It ſeemeth good to expound that phraſe in ſuch a manner.</hi> And otherwiſe it ſeemeth it would croſs your deſigne,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:53450:66"/>elſe I ſee, nor you do ſhew no reaſon. But <hi>Luther,</hi> and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers upon that place, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.7. do take the law for the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral law: but I dare ſay, you will not ſtand to their expoſition of it. <hi>Luther</hi> ſaith, This is no abſolute commendation of the law, but it is to be underſtood, <hi>legem talem factans eſſe per fidem: non talia facit lex:</hi> The law worketh not theſe it ſelf, but they are effected by the influence of the Sun of righteouſneſs, inwardly quickning, reviving, and comforting the ſoul through the faith of the Goſpel. The law giveth, nor hath no ſuch heat or vertue of it ſelf; but produceth contrary effects. It may indeed, ſaith he, convert the eye, mouth, hand, ears, <hi>&amp; omnes vires, ſed magis avertit cor odio paenarum, &amp; indignatione prohibitae concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcentiae, ſed cor non eſt rectum, &amp; ſpiritus non eſt fidelis.</hi> In brief, his judgement is, that after the ſoul is juſtified and converted by the Goſpel, then it loveth the law, which it hated before; and now it doeth not avert, or, as being afraid, ſhe from God in his law, but with confidence and delight draweth nigh unto him, and obſerveth the things of the law, becauſe the Spirit of Chriſt in the Goſpel maketh them ſweeter to the ſoul then all the riches and pleaſures of this life. Thus its the doctrine of reconciliation by Chriſt believed on, that marvelouſly altereth the Chriſtians heart, cauſing it to convert and turn to God, as being thereby able to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide his ſight and preſence, and to love his ſaw: <hi>Et Amans le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem non poteſt eam ſatis landare, adeo placet, quae prius adeo diſplicuit.</hi> You ſay nothing, that hath any ſtrength in it againſt the truth held out and maintained by us. And by this you may ſee, whence it was, that <hi>David</hi> ſo commended the law ſtrictly taken, becauſe his heart was ſo altered by the faith of the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God. It is remarkable, ſaith <hi>Luther,</hi> that the way to love and keep the law, is to believe and receive the Goſpel: from this belief iſſueth love and all true obedience, and it is not bred and effected by the law commanding and requiring it: <hi>By faith we eſtabliſh the law,</hi> Rom. 3. ult.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>M.</hi> B. <hi>That opinion which would make Chriſt not take an inſtrumental way for converſion of men in his firſt Sermon; wherein he was very large, that muſt not be aſſerted: but to hold that the preaching of the law is not a Medium to conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, muſt needs be to ſay, Chriſt did not take the neareſt way,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:53450:66"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> You anſwer your ſelf, <hi>page</hi> 169. where your words are, <hi>That our Saviours intent was only to explicate the law bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then did the Scribes and Phariſees, that ſo they might be ſenſible of ſin, and diſcover themſelves to be fouler, and more abominable then ever they judged themſelves:</hi> unto which let me add, And that by requiring and ſo letting the hearers ſee a neceſſity of a more abſolute righteouſneſs then was held forth even in the doctrine of the Scribes and Phariſees, he might ſo deſtroy all confidence in their own works, prevent the eſtabliſhing of mans righteouſneſs, and prepare and diſpoſe them to hearken after his righteouſneſs: for he is the end of the law for righteouſneſs to al that believe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.4. And by this it may appear that he uſed the law preparatorily to juſtification and converſion; as you in part are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to grant it to be the opinion and doctrine of all Orthodox Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, and yet it is thwarted by you, who love to have a way by your ſelf.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>M.</hi> B. <hi>If the law of God have that objectively in it, that may work exceedingly upon the heart when ſet home by Gods Spirit, then it may be uſed inſtrumentally, as well as the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: but it hath &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here is nothing but the vain reaſon of man. If God be otherwiſe pleaſed, what is it, how glorious, fit, and worthy ſoever it may ſeem for this in our eyes! The Sun in the firmament is a glorious object to look upon, when we have eyes: but God uſeth it not therefore to give and reſtore the uſe of ſight to thoſe that be blind: the ſeeing man findeth variety of delightful objects to look at among the creatures, but they finde him not eyes therefore.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>M.</hi>B. 5. <hi>If the law of God may be bleſſed after a man is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, to the increaſe of his grace and holineſs, why not then to the firſt beginning of it? That it is for the increaſe of of Godlineſs, appeareth by experience.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Every Chriſtians experience teacheth him, that the more he inwardly ſeeth and feeleth that divine love that pardoneth, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileth, and preſerveth the ſoul in that everlaſting covenant of ſure mercies, and peace, the more it loveth againe; and in love, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth evil, eſcheweth it, doth good, is every way cheerfully obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. <hi>I love the Lord</hi> (ſaith David) <hi>becauſe he heard me, when I called upon him in the time of trouble, and delivered my
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:53450:67"/>ſoul from death, my eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.</hi> What bred and cauſed love, and gained the heart to God at the firſt, that ſame is of continual force ſtill to enlive and enlarge the affections towards him. But becauſe ſins are forgiven, it is ſaid, <hi>ſhe loved much,</hi> Luke 7. and if this Candle be put under a buſhel, if this Sun, the light of Gods countenance, do not ſhine forth upon the <hi>Soliſſequium,</hi> the ſoul of a believer, it will be dark, dull, and indiſpoſed to whatever good you can propound to it; therefore is it requiſite that faith be nouriſhed, and ever o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perative and lively in apprehending and feeding upon that exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kindneſs of God in Chriſt, that ſo it may be more quick and free in all holy expreſſions. Faith works by love: if faith dye, or wax cold, by which the ſoul liveth, the law can but little work upon, or affect the heart. Beſides, as the Chriſtians beginning, ſo his building up and increaſing is in another way, and by other means then are meerly legal; he lives and grows in the Vine Chriſt, and thereby fructifieth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>M.</hi> B. <hi>It is hard to think that a Miniſter having opened any moral duty of the law, may not pray to God to cloath that word with power to change the heart of the hearers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Why ſhould man thinke it hard, or be offended at any thing, where he findeth it Gods will that it be ſo and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe? 2. If God reveal not his minde and willingneſs to put forth any renewing power in the law, how can you then pray in faith to be heard? 3. True prayer is for the fulfilling of his promiſe in his own way, and not in ours.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>M.</hi> B. <hi>If the Ceremonial Law, the Sacraments and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices were bleſſed by Gods Spirit, while they were commanded to be uſed for the ſtrengthening and increaſe of grace, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the deadly nature of them now then the Moral may be bleſſed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſeeing it ſtands ſtill in force.</hi>

If you can prove that the moral law was either ordained, or ſo fitted for that end,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:53450:67"/>you ſay ſomething; elſe water is not ſo weak, as is this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:53450:68"/>not then, but the truth will alſo clear and free us in all other out aſſertions. And ſo in deſpight of all ill-will, our innocency, which hath ſo unjuſtly ſuffered, and been ſo unworthily aſperſed a long time by you and others, will at laſt come to light, and we ſhall <hi>mirabile dictu,</hi> ſtand <hi>recti in curia.

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:53450:68"/>the ſouls might be healed and converted? And now you ſeem to be no longer of that minde, that by the power of the law we come to obey the law, which as you mean it is all one with conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. If we come not by the power of the law to obey, then it is by the power of the Goſpel onely: and ſo we agree. If you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, You mean, by no power inherent in the law; I ſay, There is no inherent or phyſical vertue neither in the Goſpel, to effect our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. 2. Now the queſtion muſt be onely, whether Grace may not uſe the law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is the liberty you can allow your ſelf, to alter and to ſtate the queſtion as beſt liketh you: If you miſliked the form and terms wherein you found it, why became you opponent? And now your expreſſions in this be ſo uncouth and improper, as, that grace may uſe the precepts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and your meaning in the reſidue ſo obſcure and doubtful, and I ſo unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to wrong you the leaſt jot, that I had rather forbear, then meddle any further.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall deliver my minde, (how pertinent to your queſtion, or ſatisfactory to your ſelf it ſhall prove, I know not) thus: This word of God which revealeth the riches of grace, and exceeding kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in giving righteouſneſs and ſalvation to the ſoul, is the true and proper inſtrument for the inſlaming of the affections in love both to God, his law, and all the things of God: and the law neither maketh to love God, nor its owne commands. And here you ſo mince it, that your expreſſion onely is, to make us more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as if already you granted now, that the law doth not inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally initiate or work ſanctification at firſt, but increaſe it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: conſider this well. Laſtly, Thoſe Authors you mean, are not beholden unto you for your ſo groſs and inconſiſtent interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. They ſay the law is not the inſtrument of ſanctification: Gods Spirit ſanctifieth not by the law: the law is the inſtrument of no good, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is true, you ſay, and thus they mean, that is, the law, not animated by Gods Spirit, or ſeparated from it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> So neither do either they, or any, think Law or Goſpel to be. 2. If that be their meaning, they might deny the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to be inſtrumental alſo. 3. But you read their words in the Aſſertion of grace, to be, that the Spirit doth not animate, nor uſe the law in ſanctification or converſion, ſave onely preparato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily. Now you muſt either grant us, that theſe Authors (unto
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:53450:69"/>which might be added all others of any ſpecial account, are guilty of as much Antinomianiſme, as your adverſaries are in this reſpect, or that your quarrell is as weakly managed, as it was cauſleſly undertaken: yea and that you with your ſociety have erred in opinion and practiſe. I ſhut up all with that ſo pertinent and pregnant ſaying of <hi>Calvin,</hi> on <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Si quis excipiat cum lex regula ſit pie &amp; recte vivendi, cur potius tranſgreſſionum, quam obedientia cauſa poſitadicitur?

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:53450:69"/>the promiſes in the Scripture cannot belong to the Goſpel: for the law hath its promiſes <hi>Do and thou ſhalt live in them;</hi> where life is promiſed conditionally: of this is ſpoken before, and it is of the By. 3. If the word <hi>promiſe,</hi> were onely uſed; yet being placed antithetically in oppoſition to the law, who can doubt what ſhould be meant by it? <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.18. thus uſeth it. <hi>If the inheritance be of the law it is no more of promiſe: but God gave it to</hi> Abraham <hi>by promiſe.</hi>

                     <p>M. B. 2. <hi>The State of the queſtion is not about the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, or the law, as they are both a doctrine, but as the Spirit of God working by one or the other: the not attending to this, maketh the Argument ſo confounded.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The propoſition is formally this; <hi>The Goſpel,</hi> and not the Law, is the inſtrument of true ſanctification. What need theſe cautions, and vain words? as if none can ſpeak plain Engliſh but you. And as by your Predeceſſour Dr. <hi>Tailer,</hi> ſo here we muſt be ſtiled and taken for confuſed men: but you onely are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and ſeraphical.</p>

You put no difference between regeneration, converſion, and writing the law upon the heart, which yet in propriety of phraſe, ſenſe, and uſe, are diſtinct, as is ſhewed before: who now is guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of confuſion? 3. And although the work you mean, ſhould
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:53450:70"/>be the writing of the Law in the heart; yet it followeth not to be by the law: for how then ſhould the law in ſanctification be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by faith? Laſtly, It is not the word in general, but with reſtriction, the word of the Kingdome, that is, the Goſpel, that is compared to the ſeed ſown: ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.19.</p>
                     <p>M. B. <hi>The firſt inſtance is</hi> John 17.17. Sanctifie them, &amp;c. <hi>I anſwer.</hi> 1. <hi>The word Sanctifie, when applyed to men, doth not ſignifie onely juſtification or renovation, but ſetting apart to ſome peculiar office, or charge.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The words in the Aſſertion, are, <hi>To Sanctifie,</hi> in the ſenſe of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> from whence it is taken, is to ſeparate any thing from a prophane and common uſe, and ſo to conſecrate it to God: or to convert it to a ſacred and divine uſe. So that, if you have learned men (for your great and full Library, may well exceed my poor and diminiſhed Study) who ſo take it, that Chriſt prayed here for the fitting of the Apoſtles for their great charge; yet that is of fiſhers to make them fiſhers of men, and ſo to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate them from their former prophane and worldly calling and trade, unto a ſacred; which thing my words do include and import alſo.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But then to ſanctifie them, muſt be more then to ordain them for that function, even to endue them with a great meaſure of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and gifts requiſite for ſo high a calling.</p>
                     <p>Yet, 3. All that I read, do take the word as I ſay. And ſith Chriſt doth include others alſo (even all that the Father gave him) in that prayer, I ſtill incline to their judgement.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. You ſay the word <hi>doth not onely ſignifie,</hi> &amp;c. whereas the word onely is not there, but now is foiſted in by you.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. And your meer reaſon why to ſanctifie cannot comprehend juſtification or renovation is, becauſe theſe cannot be applyed to Chriſt; who ſaith, <hi>For their ſakes I ſanctifie my ſelf, that they alſo may be ſanctified through thy truth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is much againſt you, as I conceive. For 1. did not Chriſt ſanctifie himſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> his humane nature, that he might be the root, cauſe, and means of communicating righteouſneſs and holineſs, both to juſtifie, renew and change them? 2. Neither will it follow, on the other hand, that a word of ſo extenſive a ſenſe, may not, as it is aplyed to Chriſt, be taken more ſtrictly, or in one
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:53450:70"/>ſenſe onely: and to his Elect, more largely, as it agreed to their condition.</p>
                     <p>M. B. <hi>If ſanctification do here include juſtification; how by the Antinomian principle can our Saviour pray for the juſtification of them that were already juſtified?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Anſwer your ſelf: how do you aske forgiveneſs of ſins in the Lords Prayer, and yet believe they are forgiven in your Creed? 2. His prayer is extended alſo to all that afterward ſhould come to believe through their word and miniſtery.</p>
                     <p>M. B. <hi>But in the next place, grant ſanctification for reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, how doth this prove, that the law is not uſed inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally? for our Saviours argument is univerſal, They word is truth: and may not this be affirmed of the Law, as well as of Goſpel?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Our Saviours words be indefinite. But why paſs you over theſe words in that very place, pag. 164. which be ſo mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, ſo pertinent, and ſatisfactory to this your query? <hi>viz:</hi> But if we note well what this word of truth is, it will be more evident: for this end, compare with this that place, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13. and <hi>Col.</hi> 1. where the word of truth is ſaid to be the Goſpel of ſalvation, and the Antitheſis uſed in <hi>John</hi> 1.17. ſheweth that it is a ſpecial and peculiar prerogative of the Goſpel to be called by that name by way of excellency, as alſo <hi>Calvin, Piſcator,</hi> &amp;c. affirm. Thus far in the Aſſertion, unto all which you ſtand not onely mute without a word of reply, but here you ask a queſtion, which they anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before you formed it, and ſo would have prevented. Its granted, the Law ſtrictly taken, is truth: but, as it is obſerved by all the learned, the Goſpel in many like places is ſo called <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</p>
                     <p>M. B. <hi>The next inſtance is</hi> Tit. 2.11, 12. <hi>For the grace of God bringeth ſalvation, teaching tis,</hi> &amp;c. Anſw. <hi>All this may be granted, and nothing maketh againſt this opinion: for none deny the Goſpel to be inſtrumental.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> But the place doth import it to be peculiar to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: for that word of grace, or the grace of God appearing in that word, that bringeth ſalvation, teacheth to deny ungodlineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And I put not in that word <hi>effectually</hi> ambiguouſly, as you charge me, but to avoid and prevent all ambiguity: for I grant, the Law teacheth theſe ſame things materially, but not with effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:53450:71"/>and ſucceſs as doth the Goſpel the Spirit being pleaſed to utter ſuch divine force and vertue in that Miniſtery unto the Elect.</p>
                     <p>M. B. <hi>But is not here a contradiction? The Author be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made the Goſpel and promiſe all one; whereas here it doth command holineſs and godlineſs. Is not this with the Papiſts, to make a new Law? let him reconcile himſelf.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> You are better skilled in tying knots, then in unlooſing any. If the Goſpel and promiſe be all one, that is not of my making: I found them ſo <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.18. as is ſhewed before: and ſee that you both take and leave them ſo, according to the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of Scripture. 2. You ſay, <hi>It commandeth,</hi> but there is no ſuch word in the text; but teaching to deny, that is, inſtrumentally. The holy Ghoſt is that ſpiritual unction that teacheth believers, and doth it effectually by the Goſpel,<note place="margin">Unctio docet vos. Spiritus S. efficax eſt per praedicat. Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelii.</note> ſaith <hi>Piſcator</hi> on 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.27. And this they receive, ſaith he, as the members from the head, the branches for the vine. But this is not wrought by nor effected onely by a literal and outward command. The Spirit moveth and teacheth a ſpirit, and cometh from the union with Chriſt. I wiſh your Tenets did not more interfere with Papiſts. But I forbear. Now you may ſee how your thoughts need reconciling, not my opinions: the light by this hath happily done it. Laſtly, do you deny that grace moveth or teacheth effectually, becauſe that all are not thereby ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually turned unto holineſs? then God worketh nothing effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in any, becauſe he doth not in every one: not in <hi>Peter,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not in <hi>Iudas;</hi> elſe to what purpoſe do you make this flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh?</p>
                     <p>M. B. <hi>Beſide, the Argument may be retorted upon him. What word teacheth to deny ungodlineſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that ſanctifieth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but the law doth ſo,</hi> Pſal. 119. <hi>A young man whoſe luſts are ſtrongeſt</hi> &amp;c. <hi>may be cleanſed by attending thereunto.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> But as it is retorted, it hath no force in it, for every word that teaceth doth not ſanctifie; therefore although the Law do teach, it is no conſequence: your propoſition is not univerſally true, ſo you conclude nothing. What ſay you of Philoſophical precepts and inſtructions? and of the dictating, and teaching of every natural conſcience; do theſe ſanctifie? onely this word of grace that bringeth ſalvation do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> ſo indeed if you mean Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical waſhing of the outſide onely, as of hands, cares, eyes, &amp;c.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:53450:71"/>theſe laws have waſhed their diſciples and hearers, witneſs <hi>Paul</hi> before his converſion to the faith, a man touching the Law blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs: the whole generation of the Phariſees.

That place in Pſa. 119. proveth no more, but that a young man may be cleanſed by attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the word: and who is againſt that? or what maketh it for your opinion? But that of <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> is moſt for our aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for if the Law attain ſuch effects onely when it is written in the hearts or bowels (which cometh by the new Covenant, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.) then it is not by the outward commandments, or miniſtry of it. And ſurely he could not conceive, as you ſay, that the Spirit doth uſe the Law to write it ſelf in the heart: but, as both he and others affirm, this is effected by the Goſpel, ſo <hi>Lex ſola fide ſuffulta eſt.</hi> The Law is eſtabliſhed by the preaching of Faith, which is the thing we contend for, and you have brought nothing to weaken, much leſs to overthrow it.</p>
                     <p>M. B. <hi>A third and laſt inſtance out of Scripture, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering of which, all is anſwered, from</hi> Gal. 3.2. Received ye the Spirit by the works of the Law, or by the hearing of Faith? <hi>that of the Goſpel, or doctrine of Faith. In the opening of this Text, we muſt take heed of three errors.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> A Caveat againſt all error is neceſſary; but it is well, that you accuſe your Antinomian of none of thoſe three. And it had been wiſdom in you to have taken heed of affectation of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity; for in rejecting all other of the Orthodox, you ſubſtitute a moſt doubtful opinion of your owne; as may appear by and by.</p>
                     <p>M. B. <hi>Firſt, I may demand, whether any under the old Teſtament were made partakers of Gods Spirit or no. If they were, how came they by it? there can be no other way found, but that God did give his Spirit in all thoſe publick Ordinances unto the believing Iſraelites: ſo that although they did in ſome meaſure obey the Law yet they did it not by the power of the Law, but by the power of Grace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> You might beware of co-incidency with the firſt er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror you named, of having Faith before the Spirit: for ever we
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:53450:72"/>come not to Faith by our reaſon and will; yet you grant a giving of the Spirit to believers, as if they firſt believed, then received the Spirit; but the gifts and operations of the Spirit are divers: Its by the Spirit that the ſoul cometh to union with Chriſt; and after the woman touched the hem of his garment, ſhe received a heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vertue: but let this paſs. 2. By your next expreſſion, you might ſeem to be an Antinomian: for, <hi>They obeyed the Law,</hi> ſay you, <hi>but not by the power of the Law, but by the power of Grace;</hi> what difference now? but I like not to force the joyning of hands, where the parties hearts be not firſt linked; yet the Reader may take it, as if you contradicted your ſelf; for why are your words ſo excluſive? but if it be not by the power of the Law originally, as by the firſt and principal efficient, yet you mean ſtill it is a ſubordinate and ſecondary cauſe or mean of conveyance. <hi>Egregie ſane.</hi>

                     <p>M.B. <hi>Again, in the next place (which hath alwayes much prevailed with me) did not the people of God receive the grace offered in the Sacraments, in the Circumciſion, Paſchal Lamb? They were partakers of Chriſt as well as we; and yet the Apoſtle doth as much exclude Circumciſion, and theſe Jewiſh Ordinances from grace, as any thing elſe; wherefore that there may be no contradiction in Scripture, ſome other way is to be thought upon about the expoſition of theſe words.</hi>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> When a man willingly of himſelf is going down a ſteep place, every thing will further him. If you had not firſt conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this ſilly and weak opinion of your ſelf, out of a humour of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, and deſire to be accounted the vindicator of the Law, you needed not to be ſo puzled and put to ſuch ſhifts, nor to ſeek out ſuch ſandy grounds, and tottering Pillars, to ſupport what you ſee cannot be upholden. I may ſo far credit you, that this hath prevailed with you, as you tell us: but I cannot think it alway did ſo: for you have not alway thought of this, nor alway been of this private opinion, that the Law is the doctrine of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Grant, that this prevailed to keep and continue you in that minde; yet would I learn, if I might be ſo bold, what brought you into it at firſt: ſure it came by ſome immediate inſpiration; for I ſee neither clear Scripture, nor Author for it.</p>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:53450:72"/>
                     <p n="3">3. As it hath ſo prevailed with you, ſo I am ſenſible of no force at all in it, whether to incline or carry the judgement unto it at firſt, or to keep the minde the ſame ſtill. Conſider better of it: It is granted, the people of God did receive the grace offered in their Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and were partakers of Chriſt, as well, that is, as truly and as really, as we; now what is this to your purpoſe? I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuouſly profeſs, I ſee not wherein it maketh one jot for you, or to confirm your tenet: what would you infer hence? you ſay the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle did as much exclude theſe ordinances from grace as any things elſe and as well &amp; as much as the Law; that muſt be your meaning.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Your ſelf have ſeemed ſtill to exclude the Law from Grace: and to make a direct oppoſition between them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As for Circumciſion and theſe Ordinances, being in their prime inſtitution types, yea ſignes exhibitive of Chriſt, and, if not eſſential parts, yet appendances of their Covenant of Grace (which cannot be ſaid of the Law, it being a doctrine of another nature and uſe) therefore neither the Apoſtles nor Prophets in that caſe and ſenſe did exclude them from Grace: but onely as the hypocrites,<note place="margin">Ceremonia Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis in ſua natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lae, non autem quatenus ſuo tempore Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta erant gratiae. <hi>Piſc. Gal. 3.</hi>
                        </note> and unbelievers did uſe them, as reſting in the things done, or uſing them being antiquated and our of date; or joyning them with Chriſt and Faith, as neceſſary obſervances to ſalvation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now as this aſſertion will be too bold, as unjuſtifiable, That the Apoſtle doth as much exclude the Jewiſh Sacraments in their prime, pure, and right uſe, from Grace, as he doth the Law; ſo that Argument is too childiſh, <hi>viz.</hi> If the believing Jewes were partakers of Chriſt, and did receive grace by theſe Ordinances; ſo did they receive grace by the Moral Law alſo. If you look again; there is neither contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in Scripture, nor occaſion given to ſeek out ſuch an uncouth and unwarrantable expoſition of the words.</p>
                     <p>M. B. <hi>Some there are that underſtand by the Spirit,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here, you firſt preſent your Reader with <hi>Beza's</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation; but that is miſliked, as not to your purpoſe. Again ſay you, thus it may be explained. As by faith is meant the doctrine of faith, ſo by the works of the Law is to be underſtood the doctrine of the works of the law (thus far I approve) which the falſe Apoſtles taught, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chrict was not enough to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, unleſs the works of the law were put in as a cauſe alſo.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> If you look into <hi>Act.</hi> 15. and compare verſ. 1. and 5. it
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:53450:73"/>ſeemeth that they taught Chriſt for juſtification, for it is ſaid <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>they believed;</hi> (and what ſhould they believe in Chriſt for, but for righteouſneſs?) and yet they required Circumciſion and the keeping of the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> as neceſſary to ſalvation, verſ. 1, 5. when we are juſtified, we muſt work to get heaven. So many now hold and teach, that good works, and obſerving of the Law are not needfull to juſtification, but they are to ſalvation: of which ſort you will prove one, if I miſtake not; Contrary to <hi>Act.</hi> 15.10.11. <hi>Now why tempt ye God, to lay a yoak on the Diſciples necks?</hi> &amp;c. that is, as though he could not ſave by faith: and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation now not to be ſought by grace onely in Jeſus Chriſt, ſaith the Margent. But we believe, through the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt to be ſaved, even as they (Fathers) do. Learned <hi>Zan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy</hi> ſtateth the queſtion between <hi>Paul</hi> and the falſe teachers to be, <hi>An praeter Chriſtum,</hi> &amp;c. whether beſides Chriſt, good works alſo be neceſſary to ſalvation.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>B. And if this ſhould be the ſenſe of the Text, then it was clear, that the</hi> Galatians <hi>were not made partakers of Gods ſpirit by the corrupt doctrine that was taught them of late by their Seducers, but before, while they did receive the pure doctrine of Chriſt: and therefore it was their folly, having begun in the ſpirit, to end in the fleſh: this may be a probable interpretation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yet theſe exceptions may be againſt the latter part. 1. The queſtion made by the Apoſtle is diviſive, whether they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Spirit by the doctrine of faith or by the other? for by one they muſt needs have it: And not whether they received the ſpirit by both doctrines conjoyned and confounded: ſo that you miſtake the form of the queſtion. 2. They begun in the ſpirit, while they abode in the doctrine of Chriſt for righteouſneſs and ſalvation one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and their folly <hi>in ending in the fleſh</hi> was, in that beſides the righteouſneſs of faith, they would have alſo works of the law for ſalvation, for this is to end in the fleſh, that is, in themſelves, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving begun in Chriſt by the ſpirit: or, as ſaith <hi>Piſcator,</hi> this is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led an ending in the fleſh, becauſe it is a way both heavy and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>B. That which I ſhall ſtand upon is this, The Jews and falſe Apoſtles — when they went furtheſt, joyned Chriſt
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:53450:73"/>and the obſervance of the moral Law equally together for juſtification and ſalvation: whereas the Law ſeparated from Chriſt did nothing but curſe and condemn, not being able to help the ſoul at all.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is as probable, if not more, as I ſaid, that they held Chriſt ſufficient to juſtifie, but not to ſave, without works. 2. They joyned Chriſt and the Law for juſtification and ſalvation ſay you: And you joyn them for ſanctification and ſalvation; ſo no ſuch great difference. 3. If the Law ſeparated from Chriſt did nothing but accuſe and condemn then it ſeemeth, if it be joyned with Chriſt, it will acquit and juſtifie: or you think it hath left that power to condemn being joyned to Chriſt. Came Chriſt to take that power from the Law, or to mitigate and meeken it by uniting it, to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; or to redeem his elect from under the Law, to live and abide where no Law is to accuſe? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>Who can lay any thing to their charge? Is not Chriſt alſo our ſanctification and redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well as our juſtification, without the Law,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30? <hi>This doctrine is of God,</hi> ſaith Paul there, <hi>but yours is but of man.</hi> Alſo you diſclaim that the Law of it ſelf is able to ſtirre up the leaſt Godly affection in us, but Chriſt and Law together can; and not Chriſt without it: If the ſoul be married to Chiſt her husband, he cannot make her to bring forth fruits to God, but <hi>Moſes</hi> the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer dead husband muſt be raiſed up again: and ſo the beleiver hath two husbands to make him fruitfull, and both at one time: a thing utterly againſt the Law, and the Ordinance of Mariage, civill or ſpirituall: for as in the civill, two are thereby become one fleſh; <hi>ſo they that are joyned to Chriſt are one ſpirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.17.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>B. More places of Scripture are brought againſt this: but they will come in more fitly under the notion of the Law as a Covenant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> It's true, there are many more, pag. 165. of the <hi>Aſſert.</hi> unto which as many might be added, but you have enough of theſe, the reſt you reſerve to a more fit occaſion. And I had thought to have enlarged this point, but that it is loſt labour: and I may ill ſpare any.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>B. Thus therefore I ſhall conclude this point, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that many learned and orthodox men ſpeak otherwiſe, and that there is a difficulty in clearing every particular about
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:53450:74"/>this queſtion, but as yet, that which I have delivered carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the more probability with me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> I thank you for your ingenuous and free acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I am not alone in this my opinion, as yet I think you are in yours, for any thing, I mean, that can be read in the Orthodox; for otherwiſe the whole Colledge would not have given you ſuch hearty thanks, and your book ſo ſuperlative commendation, if they inclined not your way.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Whereas you find difficulty, that is becauſe you have taken the ſtaffe by the wrong and worſt end, contending againſt the clear truth: I will not ſay againſt the light and checks of conſcience. But the more difficult, the more fit for one of your quality and parts to encounter with, that ſo your victory might happily have been more glorious. Yet you have brought it no further even in your own thoughts, but to be <hi>queſtio probabilis:</hi> and you found it in as perfect condition and ſtate when you entred upon it: nay, I ſay more, I never read that it was controverted by any Proteſtant till now: but your words imply that you may be of another mind to morrow. <hi>The Lord inſtruct, and eſtabliſh us.</hi>

I will not trouble you with commentaries directly contradicting, and overthrowing your expoſition of that place, becauſe I perceive you ſo abound in your own ſence, that their judgement is not eſteemed by you: and you have greater ſtore of them to ſatisfie you when you pleaſe, then I have. And leſt you ſhould be miſtaken, you adde, <hi>Not that we could have life by vertue of any obedience, but when we by grace are inabled to obey them</hi> &amp;c. Now I thought that you ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould have thus ſaid, (as more pertinent to the queſtion in hand) But that they do inſtrumentally vivifie, convert and give us life to obey them. But in this ſaying of yours you grant as much as we contend for: for if grace that cometh by the Goſpel do inable us to obey the Law, then it is not the Law that inſtrumentally doth convert and give life and ſtrength to walk in it. And your laſt clauſe is dangerouſly ambiguous, ſeeming to import, that Chriſt is not our ſalvation of himſelf, without our works or obedience to the Law: you will ſpeak out more plainly and fully in ſome other place.</p>
                     <p>And you give us a poor reaſon why you inclined to this your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe <hi>Socinians deny grace and juſtification under the Law or old Teſtament:</hi> as if there were no middle way to take which could like you, but either you muſt run on the rocks

                     <p>Mr. <hi>B. And thus I come to another queſtion, which is the proper and immediate ground of ſtrife between the Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and us, and from whence they have their name: And that is, the abrogation of the morall Law.</hi>

If their name be from hence, then if you prove them not guilty of the Abrogation of the Law, you and others have falſly accuſed and ſtandered them for <hi>Antinomians,</hi> and now you for ever quit them from that aſperſion.

                     <p>Here you tell us, <hi>It is hard to ſet up Chriſt and grace, and not thereby to be thought to deſtroy the Law.</hi> But it is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie with who was never ſuſpected. 2. You ſay, <hi>Your Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſtill are miſtaken in this point, and plunged into a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:53450:76"/>errour.</hi> You ſhould make your words good, and diſcover the errour, if not help them out: we expect this from you. 3. But now like blind <hi>Sampſon,</hi> unto whoſe fact you allude, you have raiſed a doctrine which will lead you to lay your hands on the chiefe pillars of the <hi>Antinomian</hi> edifice.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>B. The queſtion then at this time to be diſcuſſed, is, whether the Law be abrogated, or no, by Chriſt, to the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers under the Goſpel?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Who would queſtion it? for Chriſt came not to deſtroy the Law, but taught that every Apex or lota of it is imperiſhable, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.17, 18. Indeed your doctrine is, the Law is deprived of all power to juſtifie, accuſe, or accurſe; but who can receive it? If theſe be no tittle or part of the Lawd underſtand nothing. And yet you tell us often of promiſes of great rewards for your le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall obedience and good works; cherefore, there is a power to juſtifie, command, and bleſs eſtabliſhed by you; or elſe, which I rather think, your tenets be inconſiſtent, and mutually overthrow each other.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>B. If we would ſpeak exactly and properly, we cannot ſay in any good ſenſe, that the Morall Law is abrogated at all.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> If you would keep there, denying according to the truth of the Scripture, any mitigation at all, either totall or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall, we might ſoon agree, ſhake hands, and lay down our wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>B. We may ſay it is mitigated.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is then becauſe your Tongues are your own: or that you will ſpeak before God ſay ſo, and ſo without your War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. Such teaching, of mitigating and Evangelizing the Law, of Gods accepting the will for deed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> hath occaſioned ſuch dangerous confuſion of Law and Goſpel, theſe ſad controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies in the Church, much inſtabilitie, and many miſtakes, in the peoples minds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>B. But you muſt ſtill diſtinguiſh, when we ſpeak of the Law, ſome parts of it from the whole. Some parts of it may be aboliſhed, and yet not the whole nature of it for there are in the Law theſe parts:</hi> 1. <hi>Commands.</hi> 2. <hi>Promiſes of life to him that doth them.</hi> 3. <hi>The threatnings of eternal death to him that
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:53450:76"/>faileth. Now the Morall Law, although it be abrogated in reſpect of the two later to a believer, yet in reſpect of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer it doth ſtill abide, yea and will continue in Heaven it ſelf, as we have already proved, that one part of the Law may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide, when the other doth not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Like Foundation, like Building. This makes all your oppoſition, diſpute, and diſcourſe ſo weak and ſoon annihilated, in that your ground is ſo faulty and failing. 1. Why are you ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate thus to diſtinguiſh where God doth not? and ſo au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious, as to mutilate his good Law, which he delivered, and would have ſtill to be preſerved entire and perfect? 2. All this tendeth to nothing, but to make the Kingdom and way of the Law ſo eaſie and tolerable, that the ſoul may here find <hi>a requiem</hi> where to ſettle her abode, and never enjoy nor come to Chriſt, and dwell under his ſhadow and Kingdom, where <hi>Grace through his righteouſneſs reigneth to eternall life,</hi> Rom. 5.21. 3. What is the reaſon your diſcourſe is ſo looſe, and improper? did you not even now tell us, that to ſpeak properly and exactly, we cannot ſay in any good ſenſe the Morall Law is abrogated? and have you ſo ſoon forgotten what you ſaid? or are you regardleſs of any good ſenſe, or propriety of words? You make three parts: I would know what parts they may be called; <hi>Homogeneal,</hi> all of them truely law, as a drop of the Ocean is as verily water as the whole Sea? or <hi>Heterogeneal,</hi> as Timber and Stones be parts of a Houſe but not of the ſame kinde and nature in themſelves? and the Soul and Body be two eſſential parts conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the man; yet the one as fleſh, the other as ſpirit: and not of one of theſe alone, but the compoſitum of both is the man. So here I demand, when you tell us we muſt diſtinguiſh ſome parts of the Law from the whole, Whether theſe parts be eſſentiall and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to the making or conſtituting of the whole Law? If theſe three be all parts, then to take away two, will mutilate, if not deſtroy the whole Law, the whole conſiſting but of three, cannot be entire and perfect, having loſt two. And the rather I ask this, becauſe pag. 139. you ſay, (but prove not, for it is not your manner: your Diſciples, and ſo all other, muſt be <hi>jurati in verba Magiſtri</hi>) that the Law moſt ſtrictly taken is meer Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dative, without any promiſes at all: Now if the meer Mandative be
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:53450:77"/>a Law, why do you call the other two, (there excluded as not needfull) parts of it? and not rather, with Dr. <hi>Tailer,</hi> appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices to it? 4. To diſtinguiſh between part and part, may be granted, and uſefull; but as to diſtinguiſh between ſoul and body, between Chriſt and his Church, or between the ſigne and grace in the Sacrament; but to ſeparate and ſunder one part from the the other, you know here its intoleable, and deſtructive: and you ſo diſtinguiſh, that you plainly ſeparate and cut off two parts from the third as aboliſhed. And yet the whole nature of the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth, if we can believe you, not abrogated to the believer: you have often put your Adverſarie to reconcile his tenets, when there was no ſuch cauſe as you ſee here is to agree yours. The Law in regard of the threats and promiſes (ſay you) is abrogated: a very bold aſſertion, which never can be made good. When you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe eternall life unto every good work a believer doth, (as pag. 40.) is it not a legall and conditionall promiſe, ſo as no good work, no eternall life? and how then can you here ſay, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the Law be abrogated to a believer? And when a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, with <hi>Noah, David, Lot,</hi> &amp;c. doth fall into open and ſcandalous offences, do you not threaten and terrifie him, that he may be moved and ſtirred up, if he be ſecure, to ſeek for healing by faith in the blood of Chriſt? And doth not this alſo convincingly argue that the reproofs and threats of the Law are of force, and not abrogated? — Laſtly, if the preceptive part con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in Heaven, you cannot ſay that juſtice there ſhall be without power for the two other alſo: what though it doth not actually condemn any? Is God without power to make another World, becauſe he maketh it not? And whereas you ſay, That you have already proved two parts to be abrogated, and one ſtill abiding; you either forget your ſelf, or your <hi>ipſe dixit</hi> muſt ſuffice: you ſaid ſo much indeed, pag. 139. but proved not one ſyllable there nor here. Much more might be added to diſcover the vanity and errour of your opinions and exceptions againſt us: but this ſhall be all at this preſent.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>B. Thoſe that ſay the Law is aboliſhed, as it is</hi> foedus, <hi>but not as it is</hi> regula, <hi>ſay true. The Law may be conſidered as it is a Covenant, or as it is an abſolute Rule requiring con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity unto it. Now it may be granted, that the Law is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:53450:77"/>in the former notion, though not in the later.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thoſe that ſay the Law as it is <hi>foedus,</hi> is alſo <hi>regula,</hi> and where it doth regulate, there it is <hi>foedus</hi> a Covenant; and that the Law is neither aboliſhed as <hi>foedus</hi> nor <hi>regula,</hi> ſay moſt truly and properly according to the Scripture. If you look upon the Law and conſider it, as God propounded it, you never find an abſolute rule, where it is not a Covenant: we want your <hi>ſcriptum eſt.</hi> Though God deal with his people in a Covenant of meer mercy, it followeth not, that his juſtice in his Law is abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, or any whit diminiſhed: beſide, Chriſt having once anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and fully ſatisfied that, hath alſo made a clear way for this manner of Gods dealing: but this is onely the object of the faith of the Elect. 2. You are ready to grant what liketh you, to any one, ſave the truth to the favourers of it. In your laſt page, Law was not abrogated at all in any good ſenſe, ſay you; but now it may truely be granted: thus you play faſt and looſe as you pleaſe. In whom now is inconſtancy? You promiſe to ſhew (but take time for it, and till then we will wait) that the Law given by <hi>Moſes</hi> was a Covenant of Grace. If you underſtand it of the Morall Law, it will be denied: therefore look well what you affirm.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>B. Whoſoever expecteth life and juſtification by the Law, he ſets up the Covenant of works again: nor is it any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to ſay, Theſe works are the works of grace, and wrought by the ſpirit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. By the Law you muſt needs underſtand the Law of nature, or as it was given to <hi>Adam,</hi> for your opinion is, that the Law given by <hi>Moſes</hi> was a Covenant of grace: by which then, till it was antiquated, it ſeemeth the Church might expect life and juſtification: ſo that when God ſaid by <hi>Moſes, Whoſoever doth theſe things ſhall live in them,</hi> herein they were to ſeek righteouſneſs and life, and not by faith. I know not how you can evade, but leave it to your ſecond thoughts. 2. You ſet up the Covenant of works again, when you teach that ſalvation is due to good works by vertue of Gods promiſe, though not of merit: this doth none other but ſet up mans righteouſneſs and the Law as <hi>foedus:</hi> yet in words you would ſeem ſometime to deny it. And remember alſo your own words, <hi>viz.</hi> It is no advantage
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:53450:78"/>to theſe works, or works of grace, for ſtill it is by doing. 3. And by this now we may learn what you mean, when you ſay the Law inſtrumentally regenerateth and converteth, for it did ſo in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> time, and in the old Teſtament: that Law by your opinion was not the Law of works but the Covenant of grace, But ſeeing you ſay withall, that that Covenant of grace is now abrogated, then it is not now to be uſed to quicken and convert. It was of uſe and force in <hi>Davids</hi> time, but not now, ſay: you therefore the Argument is inconſequent. Or may we take you thus? Chriſt hath obtained that the Law given to <hi>Adam</hi> may be inſtrumentall for the Spirit; but how is it then that you bring no other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture but <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. <hi>and</hi> 119. which you grant to be meant of the Law comprehenſively, that is, as here, for the Covenant of grace? you ſee, this will not prove the Law of works to be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting word. Thus you are found further from the truth, and at great variance with your ſelf, here is much need of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling and ſalving.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>B. The Law is a rule to walk by, though not a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant be juſtified by.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The juſt both liveth and walketh by faith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. then not by the Law. 2. If the Law by <hi>Moſes</hi> be a Covenant of grace, then it was to be juſtified by. If you object, you mean the Law largely taken for the whole diſpenſation of Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Morall, Judiciall, and Ceremoniall; I reply, you cannot make all theſe of one nature, ſo not all to make a Covenant of grace. 2. To ſay the denomination is given to the better part; I anſwer, as no text warranteth this, ſo the natures of the Laws is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by changed. If you ſay of the whole heap in the floore, Its as Corn; that maketh nor proveth not chaffe to be Wheat. Alſo, ſo the judiciall, which was for the government of the Jewiſh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, is as much the Covenant of grace, as the Morall Law. But this is to decline the queſtion, and to confound what you ſhould keep diſtinct.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>B. The Antinomian diſtinction, of the Law aboliſhed, as a Law, but ſtill abiding in reſpect of the matter, is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction. — The Law, ſaith the Antinomian, in the matter of it was not denied to be a rule according to which a believer walketh and liveth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:53450:78"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> You much wrong your Adverſary, and more endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger your ſelf, if there be any evill in a falſe accuſation, as the ninth command: for he ſaith not the Law is aboliſhed, as a Law, but that it is inviolable and for ever. Neither can, nor yet would any man ſo conclude from his words but you: his words are, as you ſay, <hi>The Law in the matter of it, is not denied,</hi> &amp;c. but what ground is here to inferre an abolition? And where he ſaith, A believer walketh according to the rule of the Law; yet it is not by vertue from the Law regulating him, but from another power within, renewing and diſpoſing the heart there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. He is like the honeſt Traveller, who keepeth the high way freely of his own accord, and taketh pleaſure in ſo doing. And yet the work here is ſo imperfect, and he cometh ſo far ſhort of what is in that Law, that he findeth and acknowledgeth a power therein threatning and condemning for it: ſo that his free juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by grace is his continuall Rocke and refuge, and his faith therein the ſole preſerver of his peace and ſafety. But by your doctrine, there ſhould be no more need of juſtification, Chriſt, or faith, after converſion: for the Law hath onely a Mandative power, ſay you, but none to condemn or curſe. I muſe, that your own experience doth not convince you of your errour. Thus we reach and ſay: The Law, or more properly and plainly (that there may be no evaſion) God in his Law obligeth and bindeth unto that rule of perfect righteouſneſs, and alſo to the curſe inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably for every failing and diſobedience. You tell of a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but it is in your own tenets, which croſs and overthrow one another. And you deny God to have any Soveraigne or Reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power in his Law, but onely a Ruling, and that alſo with much mitigation and abatement of rigour in his juſtice, which yet is as indefinite as unwarrantable. In ruling and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding by his Law, he may promiſe no peace, life, nor good, ſay you, unto the obedient; nor threaten and condemn the diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient. Thus you exauthorize God in the Kingdom of his Law, and put him down from two parts of his juſtice and power re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>B. The Law is no more abrogated to a believer under the old Teſtament, then to one under the new.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> You mean, it is as much abrogated; that is, nothing at all.</p>
                     <pb n="140" facs="tcp:53450:79"/>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>B. They carry it, as if it were abrogated onely to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers under the Goſpel. Now how can this ever be made good? for either they muſt deny, that there were any belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers under the old Teſtament, or if there were, then they are freed from it as much as any man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Indeed we hold and teach according to the Scriptures, that in the daies of the Goſpel. God calleth unto, and maketh his elect partakers of a far more free, excellent, and comfortable ſtate and condition then was before Chriſt, as <hi>Galat.</hi> 4.1, 2. <hi>Now I ſay that the Heire, as long as he is a Child, differeth nothing from a ſervant, though he be Lord of all: But is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Tutors, untill the time appointed by the Father.</hi> You ſay, Either we muſt deny that there were any believers under the old Teſtament, or they were freed as much as any now. Let any of a mean capacity but mark the Apoſtles words, <hi>The Heir ſo long as he is a Child, differeth nothing from a ſervant,</hi> &amp;c. this repreſenteth the ſtate of believers in that Infantile age, which dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth not from a ſervant; how then ſay you, that they were freed from the Law as much as now? will you make the condition of the Child being ſix or ſeven yeers old, and ſo kept under his Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian and Tutor, to be as free as when being of full age, he is at his own diſpoſing? You ſay, If the Law be taken for the whole ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, you grant it was Pedagogicall and more ſervile. But was not this ſervility principally, yea, and as concerning the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and the ſpirituall ſtate of the ſoul, ſolely cauſed by the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Law, which like a thick cloud, and dark, of ſin and wrath (<hi>Rom.</hi> 3.21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.15.) did interrupt and hinder their light, and make the Heavens black over their heads, ſo that they could not, all that while, break perfectly thorow that veil which lay ſo on them? the ſacrifices and other ceremonies indeed were a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and bondage in reſpect of the outward ſtate, but not as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the conſcience, which is chiefly intended by <hi>Paul.</hi> And therefore it muſt be underſtood of that ſervility they were in by the Morall Law more then now; and in regard of this Morall Law eſpecially, ſaith <hi>Calvin,</hi> were they ſaid to be under a heavy yoke, as <hi>Act.</hi> 15.10. And how can the Law Pedagogically taken, be the ſame to them, as to us, in reſpect of juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſalvation, as you tell us, whereas you granted this Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:53450:79"/>to be altogether antiqnated? pag. 205. <hi>l.</hi> 20.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>B. If then we ſpeak of the Law in regard of the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial parts of it, which are directing and commanding, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and promiſing life upon perfect obedience, theſe are ſtill equally in power, or elſe equally abrogated to all believers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the old or new Teſtament.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> If theſe all and every of them be now confeſſed to be eſſentiall parts of the Law, then none of theſe be appendices or meer acceſſaries, as D. <hi>Tailer</hi> accounteth them: and you in pag. 59. do make direction and obligation the onely eſſentiall parts of a Law, and threatnings and premiſes to be but conſequences re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired <hi>ad bene eſſe:</hi> ſo inconſiſtent and mutable are you in your po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions. And if theſe alſo be eſſentiall why did you oppoſe it in the Aſſertion of grace? Againe, then to abrogate any of theſe, is more then to diminiſh one Apex or Iota of the Law; and ſo who now is become leaſt in the Kingdome of God? But laſtly, the Law in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of theſe, is not equally in power to the faithfull under both Teſtaments: for it is more then evident that the believing Jews were put under the teaching and government of it, as a Child in non-age is made ſubject to his Schoolmaſter or Tutor, and that by the will and appointment of God, <hi>Gala.</hi> 4, 13. <hi>Gala.</hi> 3.23. <hi>Before faith came, we were kept under the Law,</hi> &amp;c. 24. <hi>Wherefore the Law was our Schoolmaſter unto Chriſt.</hi> 25. <hi>But after faith is come, we are no longer under a School-maſter.</hi> Now the time appointed by God the Father, was till the reſurrection of Chriſt, which he calleth <hi>the coming of faith,</hi> or <hi>tempus Evangelii,</hi> the time of preaching the Goſpel to all for the obedience of faith; and hereby he calleth and bringeth his Church into a more fice and happy condition; therefore now is the Church ſaid to receive <hi>the Adoption of the Sonnes,</hi> Gala. 4.5. that is, ſay Interpreters, The liberty and right pertaining to Sonnes, which was not granted before Chriſt was exhibited. And ſaith <hi>Calvin,</hi> Truly <hi>Paul</hi> doth not ſpeak here only of the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, nor of the Morall Law ſeverally, but comprehendeth the whole oeconomy or Miniſtery of <hi>Moſes,</hi> by which God then go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned his people. And if the whole, then it followeth that the Law Morall is not now equally in power, as then. Alſo, do not you ſay, that the Morall Law is onely now of force to a believer
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:53450:80"/>in the mandative and directive part, but not in the promiſſive or threatning. So that it concerneth you to conſider, that thoſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for ſubjection under the old Teſtament, are not ſo ſtrong and valid againſt believersnow, ſith the Church is in the condition of the Heir that is grown up, and of ripe age.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>B. Therefore it is wild divinity of an Antinomian,</hi> Hony C. pag. 6. <hi>who makes three different eſtates of the Church.</hi> 1. <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder the Law.</hi> 2. <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder John the Baptiſt.</hi> 3. <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder the Goſpel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Why is it wilde? In that it groweth not in your Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, or liketh not your fancy: ſo alſo there are other pretious truths, like choice flowers, which are diſliked, and caſt out as unſavory weeds, by your Doctrine and Miniſtery. You ſhould have ſhewed ſome cauſe of diſtaſte, which you do not, unleſs you include it in theſe words — <hi>He compareth theſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and ſheweth how we under the Goſpel exceed thoſe of the Law,</hi> &amp;c. but here I ſee, that as you cannot receive it for truth, ſo you dare not plainly reject it for errour. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour in that point hath given full ſatisfaction to the indifferent Reader, otherwiſe I ſhould adde much more.</p>
                     <p>There is great difference between the time of promiſe, and of exhibition, or performance. <hi>It was revealed unto the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets that not unto themſelves, but unto us they did Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the things that are now reported unto you,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.12.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>B. There are two notorious falſhoods.</hi> 1. <hi>That God indeed ſaw ſin in believers in the old Teſtament, but not in theſe of the new.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> To ſee ſin is as an Act of Gods juſtice in the legall Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, under which they were in the old Teſtament; but now (as is cleared) we are not under that Miniſtration, as ſometime you yeeld; ſo that it may follow, that God might ſee ſin in thoſe, and not in theſe. You conceive and think of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reference to his word, and would have ſin the object of his eternall and incomprehenſible ſight in a carnall ſenſe and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Can you believe <hi>that God remembreth the ſinnes of his people no more.</hi> as his Covenant is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.12? And why not then be perſwaded of this?</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>B. Was not that place,</hi> God ſeeth not iniquity in Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:53450:80"/>
                        <hi>ſpoken of the Church in the old Teſtament? and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, If the Godly were in Chriſt, then doth it neceſſarily follow by his principles, That God muſt ſee no ſin in them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Authour took that place, as I remember, to be a Propheſie of a future ſtate.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Though they were in Chriſt, yet not being <hi>adulti,</hi> but in their time of minority, under that legall government, God might ſee and impute ſin temporally unto them: ſo there appeareth no abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity or contradiction, but that you love to have your own words.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>B. The ſecond difference he maketh is, that God ſeeing, did therefore puniſh and afflict for it; but he doth not ſo now. So</hi> Moſes <hi>was ſtricken with death,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Now who ſeeth not how weak and abſurd theſe Arguments are? for doth not the Apoſtle,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. <hi>ſpeaking of thoſe under the new Teſtament, ſay, That ſome were ſick, ſome did ſleep? were not</hi> Ananias <hi>and</hi> Sapphira <hi>ſtruck dead immediately?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Your words indeed are, that his Arguments are weak and abſurd; but you make no ſuch thing to appear. As for that of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. his Anſwer to it ſtill may ſuffice: for you ſhew not any invalidity of it, nor regard his diſtinctions there given. Beſides, It will not be granted that thoſe <hi>Corinthians,</hi> nor yet <hi>Ananias,</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> were believers: And ſo your reaſon fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth ſhort of the point in queſtion.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>B. The Arguments of the</hi> Antinomians, <hi>for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part, do not onely overthrow the uſe of it to believers, but to unbelievers alſo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Their Arguments, if rightly conceived of, and uſed, do not overthrow the uſe of the Law to either: but then you muſt keep it within its own proper limits, and uſe it lawfully. I grant, if you underſtand thoſe words. <hi>The Law is a School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter to Chriſt hiſtorically onely,</hi> (for ſome make a myſticall and ſpirituall ſence of them alſo) then the meaning is, that the ſame believing Jew who before was under the Law, yet ſince Chriſt is freed from that ſervitude, and ſo his ſtate is changed; that Pedagogy is no longer; yea, and believer or unbeliever in the daies of the Goſpel, we are not to meddle with that adminiſtration by <hi>Moſes,</hi> but onely to give care to the Goſpel, which is preached to all for the obedience of faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.2, 5. but then
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:53450:81"/>it will neceſſarily follow, that he that believeth is actually freed from the yoke of the Law: if from the whole occonomy, then from every part. And he liveth by his faith onely under meer free grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>B. We will grant that to a believer the Law is as it were abrogated in theſe particulars.</hi> 1. <hi>In reſpect of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi> 2. <hi>Condemnation.</hi> 3. <hi>Rigid obedience.</hi> 4. <hi>Its no terrour, nor are the godly ſlaviſhly compelled to obey.</hi> 5. <hi>It doth not work, nor increaſe ſin, as in the wicked.</hi> 6. <hi>It is abrogated in many acceſſaries and circumſtances.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> You ſay you had rather uſe the word Mitigation then Abrogation: as being proper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And I miſlike both as they are uſed in reference to the Law for both Scripture and experience ſhew that neither word is incident nor can poſſibly befall the Law of God; for it is inviolable. If the Fire burn you not, not Sea drown you, its not becauſe they have loſt that naturall power to do it, but in that you happily are kept out of either; ſuch as abide un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law find no true abrogation or mitigation. And if the Law juſtifie not, it's not becauſe the power of it to do it is loſt or leſſened, for then it could not promiſe life to the obſervers, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Do. and live;</hi> but in that it doth not juſtifie, and give life actually to any, that weakneſs is not in the Law, but in man through the fleſh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. for the Law neither can, nor ever yet had power to juſtifie a ſinner, nor one that failed the leaſt in the obſervance of it.</p>
                     <p>And the like may be ſaid in reſpect of condemnation. The Law curſeth and threatneth upon <hi>Sinai,</hi> but cometh not on <hi>Mount Sion.</hi> In Chriſt we are freed from the Law, and ſo from its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; ſo the change is in the ſtate of a Chriſtian, but no al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in the Law at all. Your own expreſſion cleareth it: While the Law by reaſon of ſinne doth purſue me, I runne to Chriſt for refuge, and ſeek to be found in him: this I implyeth that the Law hath not loſt any of its threatning or curſing power, and that my ſecurity is not — that the Law wanteth power to condemn, but that I am in Chriſt, and under his protection, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9.</p>
                     <p>As for your third reſpect of mitigating the rigid obedience, as you call it, yet I ſee you are forced to yeeld what D. <hi>Tailer</hi>
                        <pb n="145" facs="tcp:53450:81"/>and others did not, that it cannot be maintained. If we fail in the leaſt tittle, we are preſently gone by the Law. And as Chriſt hath not obtained at Gods hand, that the Law ſhould not oblige and tye us to a perfect obedience; ſo you might as truly ſay, he hath not procured, that the Law ſhould not juſtifie us being ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: for this it could not do before. But I am glad to have ſuch words from you, that all our obedience is accepted, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of any mitigation in Gods juſtice, or for dignity in the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but onely in and through Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. the beſt piece of Divinity I find in your Book: but then there is no mitigation of rigid obedience in the Law.</p>
                     <p>To the fourth. To ſpeak properly the Law is therefore no ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, becauſe a believer is not under it: for it is a terrour to all that be under it: the Chriſtian being under grace, is free from ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. And if he be ſometime or ſomething afraid, that is not becauſe there is not fulneſs of ſecurity in his condition, but through the imperfection of faith; as children, we fear, where and when, we have no true cauſe: neither doth it argue any leſs terrour in the Law. And you have ſome ſtrange add unſound expreſſions in this Section: for grant a regenerate and ungenerate part, yet the man is but one, and his ſtate but one, not two: and put the Law with its terrour and compelling power to the fleſh, what a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth this? Can this draw the fleſh to the waies of piety, as your words are? you imagine either that the fleſh, being and remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fleſh, can move in the waies of piety, or that the terrour of the Law can change the corrupt heart: but can clear or juſtifie neither. It is ſimple and free believing, that leadeth and carrieth the ſoul into the right way: and all the forcing and terrifying of the Law can provoke onely unto an externall and hypocriticall obedience, ſuch as is in the Children of the Bondwoman. If the ſpirit in the godly be not alway ſo willing, the Law cannot give aide and quickening to it, but rather dampeth and deadeth the ſpirit of faith and love, and doth vivifie the corruption in nature, for ſo ſaith <hi>Paul, when the Commandment came, ſin revived and I died,</hi> Rom. 7.9. and againe, <hi>the ſtrength of ſin is the Law,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.56. It's onely faith in the Goſpel of Chriſt that exciteth to all goodneſs cheerfully and joyfully, ſo <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, Abraham, Moſes,</hi> are ſaid to do all by faith. <hi>Sine qua,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:53450:82"/>multa faciendo nihil facimus: &amp; impleudo Legem, non im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plemus.</hi> What cauſed life at firſt, muſt preſerve, and quicken it being dead or dull.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. And your fifth Aſſertion is falſe: for the Law doth (as is ſaid and proved) increaſe ſin even in the faithfull, this being the bitter effect of it through the vitiouſneſs of our nature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.5. <hi>The motions of ſin which were by the Law, do work in our members to bring forth fruit to death;</hi> and all along the chapter, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, It wrought no otherwiſe in him, in his rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate eſtate; but that all the power to reſiſt, weaken, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome ſin and the fleſh, was from Chriſt the head, and his ſpirit. <hi>Therefore thankes be to God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This take notice of, that if infidelity be accidentally nouriſhed, and faith hindered and oppoſed by the Law, as is moſt true, then ſin cannot decreaſe, but doth increaſe by it. Beſides, is not fleſh and corruption in the regenerate of the ſame kinde with that in the unregenerate? If the Law then be the occaſion of the reviving of ſin in the one, why not in the other? the nature of the fleſh, nor the operative vertue of the Law is not altered by grace, though they both be overmaſtered and ſubdued.</p>
                     <p>In the ſixth you ſlander your <hi>Antinomian</hi> again for diſpara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the Law, in that it was written in ſtones. What good can it do, ſay you? <hi>Anſw.</hi> It doth good many waies, elſe God would not have writ it there: but that cannot make man good. God therefore hath promiſed to write his Law in the Tables of the heart by his ſpirit, whereby the Goſpel alſo is made effectuall as he pleaſeth: but this inward writing of the Law, is a promiſe and branch of the new Covenant, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>B. But the Law continueth to them as a rule, which may appear, firſt, from the different phraſes uſed concerning the ceremonial law, nowhere applied to the moral; as which</hi> Chem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitius <hi>doth reckon up,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>which are not uſed of the Morall: but when he ſpeaketh of it, he ſaith,</hi> We are dead unto it, We are redeemed from the curſe of it: <hi>which Phraſes do imply the change to be wade in us, and not in the Law.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Your ſuppoſition is ſtill falſe, for we hold no abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, mitigation, or mutation in the Law, as is already cleared.
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:53450:82"/>2. This maketh wholly for us: for if there be no change in the Law, then it continueth in all other offices and regards, as well as to be a rule: and ſo hath power to promiſe and to condemn alſo. <hi>Hunc ſuo jugulo gladio.</hi> 3. You reaſon <hi>nihil ad Rhom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum, viz.</hi> If the <hi>Antinomian</hi> could bring ſuch places, that would prove it were as unlawfull to <hi>love the Lord,</hi> becauſe the morall Law commands it, as we could prove it unlawfull <hi>to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſe, &amp;c. Anſw.</hi> The rule of compariſon requireth, that it ſhould be unlawfull to circumciſe, becauſe the ceremoniall Law commands it. And if that Law were of force ſtill, and not repealed, it were as lawfull to circumciſe: ſo that the unlawfulneſs to do it, is not from the nature of the thing, but in that the ceremoniall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring circumciſion, is abrogated, but ſo is not the moral: for then to love were not required. But though the morall Law command love, yet your heart wanting it, it giveth it no power to do it. Thus you have gained here nothing to your purpoſe, but loſt both labour and credit.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> 2. <hi>From the ſanctification and holineſs that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of the believer, which is nothing but conformity to the Law.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though the Law require, yet it proveth not it to be a rule, regulating, diſpoſing and framing the ſoul to holineſs; for the Law doth not ſanctifie: but Chriſt is of God made to be ſanctification, whereby cometh true conformity to the Law. The Law requireth to be juſt, but doth not juſtifie: ſo it willeth us to be Saints, but ſanctifieth not. There is a mutuall relation between Chriſt and faith: as a quality, or vertue, faith purifieth not; but as it fetcheth and deriveth vertue from Chriſt. Purity is not in us naturally, the Law requiring it, doth convince us both of the want of it, and of the neceſſity to have it, but it ſupplieth us not with it: (for then Chriſt need not be our root of holineſs, nor we by faith to have it from him) but driveth us to Chriſt, in whom all fulneſs dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth. You have your Anſwer to the reſt of the Section, in what precedeth.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> See Act. 15.5. <hi>There aroſe up certain of the Sect of the Phariſees, which believed ſaying, That it was needfull to circumciſe them, and to command them to keep the Law of Moſes.</hi> Note that expreſſion, <hi>which believed:</hi> So that the queſtion was then, Whether that circumciſion and the keeping of the Law were needfull to be conjoyned with the faith of Chriſt,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:53450:83"/>in the point of ſalvation, and ver. 11. makes it more plain: <hi>We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve through the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt to be ſaved, even as did they alſo.</hi> I confeſs your firſt words might import as much; but you are not conſtant, but ſhrinke much from this; And tell us what opinion the Jews were generally of, who thought that the obſervation of the morall Law without Chriſt, was enough for their peace and comfort. In your proſecution of it, you ſejoyne, what in the propoſition was rightly conjoyned. Thoſe Jews who thought, as you ſay, That the external performing of the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and a life outwardly conformable to the morall Law, would ſecure them; they did oppoſe Chriſt, and perfecute his Goſpel, as 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.14, 15. But the other, mentioned <hi>Act.</hi> 15. did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and preach the Goſpel, though not according to the ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city that is in Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3. but added and mingled other things to that of faith, and ſo overthrew the whole Goſpel, and ſalvation alſo. Hence it was the Apoſtle peremptorily ſaid, that, <hi>If they were circumciſed, Chriſt profited them nothing;</hi> implying that they would have Chriſt and circumciſion too. Your words are, <hi>That the Apoſtle ſpeaketh ſeemingly derogatorily to the Law, becauſe they took it without Chriſt.</hi> But he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed derogated not from it, but acknowledged it to be good, if uſed lawfully; but they did otherwiſe; not in taking it without Chriſt, as you affirm; but in conjoyning it with him, as if he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone were not ſufficient to ſalvation as well as to righteouſneſs, without the works of the Law. Take you heed of this way, and kinde of teaching.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>B. Now where the Law ſeemeth to be abrogated, it is taken either</hi> 1 <hi>Synecdochically put for that part which actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally condemneth, as</hi> Gal. 5. <hi>Againſt ſuch is no Law: for he ſpeaketh, as if there were nothing in the Law but condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Whereas we may ſay, the Law is by way of direction and preſcription; for a thing, as well as againſt it by accuſation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> If it be ſaid, the Law of our Land hath nothing againſt you or to accuſe you of in point of homicide, Is this any ſeeming abolition of the Law? while your innocency is cleared and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, the Law ſuffereth no diminution by it: how tryfling and childiſh is this your diſcourſe? 2. If the Law be for a thing in direction, and againſt it by accuſation, then by <hi>Pauls</hi> doctrine
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:53450:84"/>ſtill it hath loſt nothing of its power. Thus the conſtant miſtake is not ours, but yours, who moſt aboliſh the Law indeed.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>B. Firſt, He is without the Law, that is without the underſtanding of it: thus the Gentiles. Secondly, Without the ſenſe and experience of the terrifying power of it, as</hi> Paul, Rom. 7. <hi>Now the godly, though they be denied to be under the Law, yet are not ſaid to be without it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true, the faithfull have both underſtanding and experience of the Law: but now, faith <hi>Luther,</hi> It is their cheif point of wiſdom to be ignorant of the Law. Is not this a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox</hi> or <hi>Parable?</hi> You ſay <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 4.14. cannot mean the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> for that was long after: a poor reaſon. Doth he not, in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. <hi>deny the bleſſing and inheritance of</hi> Abraham <hi>to be by the Law, but by promiſe?</hi> and yet ver. 11. he ſaith, <hi>The Law was</hi> 430 <hi>yeers after.</hi> When the bleſſing was promiſed to come in that way to <hi>Abraham,</hi> there was no queſtion: but now ſince the circumciſion and the Law were after added to the promiſe, and have been of ſo long continuance, is that queſtion thereby occaſioned.</p>
                     <p>In the fifth Interpretation of what it is to be under the Law, your words are nothing againſt us, but rather confirme that expoſition of <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. which is in the <hi>Aſſertion of grace</hi> againſt D.<hi>T.</hi> But obſerve withall, how here you oppoſe Law and grace in ſanctifying and healing, which formerly you ſo much contradicted. You ſay, The Law is never ſo much alive, <hi>as in the godly, who moſt obey it.</hi> But I ſay, It is the ſpirit of Chriſt that quickeneth them by the Goſpel, to love and obey the Law: and their obedience floweth from this life of faith, as an expreſſion of it. He that liveth by faith, as <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.19, 20. keepeth the Law joyfully, and freely.</p>

                     <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> I <hi>Have already handled the Law as a rule, and now come to conſider it as a Covenant, that ſo the whole Law may be fully underſtood.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Your undertaken be great, and your promiſes ſat and fair, but never knew I worſe ſucceſs, nor leſs performance. I muſe that theſe points ſo weighty, and ſo much controverted, ſhould be ſo ſleightly handled, and your Affirmative part ſo weakly confirmed by a man of your learning. Suppoſe all be clear and unqueſtionable to your ſelf: (which I cannot believe now) yet others need more light then as yet you hold forth. And your Adverſaries ſee nothing to convince and ſatisfie them. You tell us, He that is ſo blinde that he cannot ſee by the light of one Sun, would not ſee any more if there were a thouſand Suns. Alas, do you think that he that readeth then, ſhall find theſe your ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate and judicious Lectures ſo clear, and beyond exception, that he is like unto him that hath the nooneday to walke in; and is ſtrangely blinded, if any thing be rejected as erronious, or queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as obſcure? To give you my ingratefull opinion, I neither ſee light of one Sun, nor yet of one beam of it. I fear you are too ſelf-conceited, and ſelf-confident. I ſay no more, but <hi>Aliorum eſto judicium.</hi> We are now, being made publique, to be cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by others.</p>
                     <p>Now you come to conſider the Law as a Covenant, &amp;c. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Then it is not ſimply a rule: but it may be you will help this ſomwhat, by telling us of a more large acception of the Law; yet that is not to ſpeak preciſely to the point in controverſie; alſo, though your conſiderations be divers, yet the Law is conſtantly the ſame. Your doctrine, that the Law was delivered in <hi>Mount Sinai</hi> in a Covenant-way, or it was a Covenant God made with his people; I liſt not to meddle with by-matters. You then ſhew
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:53450:85"/>what a Covenant is: And as here you ſay, You find much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of judgement: ſo I ſay, You are unhappily perſwaded to incline to the moſt unlikely, unfound, and palpably erronious opinion of all others, if yet you have any to travel and go with you, in your way; but you love croſs and by-wayes, that you may be better noted, to become famous or infamous.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>B. The Law as to this purpoſe may be conſidered more largely, as that whole doctrine delivered on</hi> Mount Sinai, <hi>with the preface and promiſes adjoyned, and all things that may be reduced to it: or more ſtrictly, as it is an abſtracted rule of righteouſneſs, holding forth life upon no terms but perfect o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. Now take it in the former ſence, it was a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace: take it in the later, it was not of grace, but of works.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is firſt to be premiſed, and we take it as granted by you, that however you conſider the Law, yet you mean onely the moral Law. Yet you will not be contented with the ſimple and entire law as it is an abſolute law in it ſelf, but do take in alſo unto it, the preface, promiſes and all things reduceable; your extent of it is now become large indeed, and to me indefinite. What you draw in and reduce to it, who knoweth? But I ſmell ſome feare and diffidence in this great enterprize: your own thoughts being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of the unjuſtifiableneſs of this ſtrange and bold aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, you would not therefore be too narrowly kept in, but will take more ſcope and ground then is allowable: but let this paſs, and to come to a more particular reply.</p>
                     <p>Methinks the Pieface it ſelf ſhould have been ſufficient to have ſtopt you in this your way or opinion. Thus it is recorded, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.2. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.6. <hi>I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out,</hi> &amp;c. out of which I collect, and it is plain and undeny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, That God was their God, and Iſrael his people, before the giving of the Law: and that he did not in theſe words expreſs his wilingneſs and conſent to be their God, if, or upon condition, they will keep theſe his Commandments, which you call the firſt thing belonging to a Covenant: therefore he ſaith, <hi>Hear, I am thy God,</hi> that is, I am now already <hi>thy God,</hi> namely, by free promiſe in the ſeed of the woman, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. or as it was made to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his poſterity, <hi>Gen</hi> 12.3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.6. <hi>To</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:53450:85"/>
                        <hi>and his ſeed were the promiſes made.</hi> And unto this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe or Covenant of grace, (then which I know no other in ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple nature and eſſence, or ſubſtance) they had given and profeſſed their conſent formerly by their faith, and externally by receiving circumcifion the ſigne of the Covenant, and ſo avouched God to be their only God in Chriſt, and themſelves his people through him. And he being their God and King, it pleaſed him now to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver unto them his will in this way and form of Government, according to which he would rule them, and they were to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form themſelves to his pleaſure herein.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And this promiſe given by God, and believed on by them ſo long before this promulgation and ſolemne delivery of the Law, was entire of it ſelf, containing perfection of doctrine, and holding out a free and clear way to pardon, reconciliation, and life. And therefore it was ſingly made &amp; preached at firſt to <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> with his poſterity: ſo that <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.18. <hi>God gave the Inheritance</hi> (that is, all the bleſſedneſs belonging to a Child) <hi>bylpromſe,</hi> denying and excluding the Law in this. And hence is it, that (to prevent all objections againſt the doctrine of free grace) <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20. <hi>Moreover the Law entered, that the offence might abound.</hi>

                        </gap>. that is, the Law entered beſides the promiſe of grace, which was the prime and principall doctrine: and it entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church, or among the people of God, and yet neither to diſannull, nor to adde any thing unto the former Covenant or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.15. as if, of imperfect before, it was to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected thereby; Nor yet as if it were to be mingled with the promiſe and ſo to adulterate it: but it was to be kept diſtinct from it, as being of another nature, and for another end, contrary to that of the promiſe, The Law was to uncover ſin, terrifie the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, exclude the ſoul from Gods favour and preſence: the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to cover, to pacifie and comfort, and to admit or give en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance again with confidence through faith in Chriſts blood. The Law was to make ſin abound, that upon that occaſion the ampleneſs and efficaciouſneſs of the grace promiſed in Chriſt, might be more abundant.</p>
                     <p>And as for the promiſes of the Law, <hi>Piſcator</hi> telleth you, That they are to be excluded the Covenant of grace, as being of a
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:53450:86"/>diverſe nature or quality from thoſe promiſes of grace. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of grace is <hi>Nuda, ſimplex, &amp; gratuita:</hi> the legall promiſes are <hi>Conditionales.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But now we will conſider by what Scriptures and Reaſons you would confirm it. Firſt, you ſay,</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>B. There is nothing more ordinary with</hi> Paul <hi>in theſe controverſies, then to conſider the Law ſo differently; as take this inſtance,</hi> Rom. 10.5.6. <hi>where he deſcibeth the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the Law, from theſe words,</hi> Do and live, <hi>&amp;c. We find this in effect,</hi> Deut. 30.16. <hi>and yet from this very</hi> chap. <hi>The Apoſtle deſcribes the righteouſneſs which is by faith. And</hi> Beza <hi>doth acknowledge, that that which</hi> Moſes <hi>ſpeaks of the Law,</hi> Paul <hi>applieth to the Goſpel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> We might expect a more plain and clear text then this, (which is ſo knotty and difficult, that it hath troubled the beſt commentators) if yet you could produce any:<note place="margin">

If you ſtand here to <hi>Beza,</hi> his words make directly againſt you. <hi>What</hi> Moſes <hi>ſpeaks of the Law,</hi> Paul <hi>applieth to the Goſpel,</hi> ſaith he: Moſes <hi>ſaid thus of the Law, and</hi> Paul <hi>of the Goſpel.</hi> Thus then by his interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 1. The Law is not one with the Goſpel, nor doth it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it, but containeth a doctrine in kinde differing from the Goſpel or Covenant of grace. 2. He ſeemeth to be of that judgement, (with many others) that <hi>Paul</hi> doth but allude to that place in <hi>Moſes,</hi> and doth not directly and purpoſely cite <hi>Moſes</hi> for confirmation: and this is moſt probable, in that ſomething is added, ſome left out, and ſomething altered. <hi>Calvin</hi> thinkes the knot may eaſily be untied,<note place="margin">— Sed totam in genere do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinam, quae <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>God on the one part, and the Iſraelits on the other. God did not deal as this time as abſolutely conſidered, but as
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:53450:86"/>their God and their Father: hence God ſaith he is their God. And when Chriſt quoteth the Commands, he brings the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,</hi> Hear O Iſrael, the Lord thy God is one: &amp; <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4. <hi>Now unleſs this were a Covenant of grace, how could God be their God, who were ſinners?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> God dealt with them now, not abſolutely indeed, but yet with relation to his promiſe formerly made, by meanes of which he had freely choſen, and taken them to be his peculiar people: having long before ſaid to <hi>Abraham, I will be a God to thee, and to thy ſeed after thee,</hi> Gen. 17.7. And hereupon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Martyr Mr. <hi>Bradford,</hi> intending to comfort one dejected and diſtreffed in mind, upon conſideration of ſome failing or want of obedience, as I remember writeth to this effect. <hi>Let this cogitation be ſtill in your mind, that before God aske any thing of us, he ſaith, he is ours: I am the Lord thy God:</hi> giving himſelf, and then all he hath, to be ours. And this he doth in reſpect of himſelf, of his own mercy and truth, and not in reſpect of us: for then <hi>were grace no grace.</hi> In conſideration whereof, ſaith the Martyr, Whatever he commands, though of duty we be bounden to accompliſh, and be culpable and guilty if not; yet he requireth the ſame no further of us, then to make more in love, and more certaine of this his covenant, <hi>That he is our Lord God, which is made in reſpect of his grace in Chriſt Jeſus, and dependeth nothing on our obedience.</hi> So this Covenant is moſt free and moſt ſure for ever, and the onely refuge and plea of the ſoul in the hour of tentation. It is more then evident then, that God as now, ſo from the firſt, ſtood reconciled to his people in Chriſt Jeſus, and in him became their God, and took them into that happy relation of being his people, his peculiar treaſure, and Children. And all your Scriptures, if now you look on them again, do hold forth this, and can ſpeak no other truth. What infirmity is this? Cannot God take a people into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with himſelf, and become their God and Father in Chriſt his Son, and yet govern and put them under the Law, but we muſt then inferre, either that all his grace and favour is conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, or elſe the Law we are made to live under for a time, is a Covenant of grace?<label type="milestone">

It is one word and way by which we are begotten and become Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to God our Father: and he may rule us, and ſhew us fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour by another word and way, eſpecially whilſt we be in mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3. And what could keep the Children of Iſrael in the conſcience of their many faults and failings from deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair? or what could erect their ſpirits, and preſerve ſtill a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and cheerfull hope in them? was it not, as Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> ſaid, That knowledge and inward perſwaſion, that God was their Father, and they his Children, by a free and faithfull promiſe of meer grace in Chriſt to come?</p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Now I underſtand what you would have reduced to the morall Law. And in this paſſage of yours, I obſerve divers ſtrange things; as, 1. That the ceremoniall ſhould be reduced to the morall, as if the one were not entire and abſolute of it ſelf, without the other: or that they were not diſtinct <hi>ſpecies,</hi> under the ſame <hi>genus:</hi> the whole Miniſtration by <hi>Moſes,</hi> being divided into Law morall, ceremoniall, judiciall, ſo that every of the three is abſolute of it ſelf, for the matter and doctrine contained in it, and in reſpect of the end and uſe it was given for. 2. You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not let us ſee one ſyllable concerning the ſacrifices in the ſecond Command. The Lord delivered by the ſame authority he had over them, and as equally and immediately required the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of each of theſe, which in nature and office were ſo diſtinct. And the charging of Iſrael with all and every of them is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſtill upon this, <hi>I am thy God:</hi> therefore was it, that his people were to be inſtructed, governed, and ordered as he pleaſed. He ſignified his will and mind, in the matters of faith, by the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall Law. 2. Touching morality and duty in the morall. 3. And what concerned the polity, and republique, in the judiciall Law. I ſee not, but that you may as well reduce the judiciall to the firſt Commandment, or to the ſecond Table, as the ceremoniall to the ſecond Commandment, and thus confound all, making but one Law. 3. And I marke another thing, <hi>viz.</hi> That in this you have one eye, and reſpect to the conſent or opinion of Divines, as the beſt, yea ſole reaſon and warrant you have for this, whereas you regard not their concurrence in other things. 4. Your inference is as ſtrange, <hi>viz.</hi> That there muſt then ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be grace included in the morall Law: for ſuppoſe your reducement be true, yet the ſame grace was ſtill contained and kept in the ceremoniall as before: and it could import no whit of its native vertue, or as a phyſicall ingredient, infuſe its ſpirit, ſtrength, or force, to alter and qualifie the Law of works: for then grace were no more grace, nor works no more works. If you make the morall ſo capacious, as to receive into it the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as a greater Orbe the leſſer, or as your Cheſt doth a box of oyntment, or the Ark the Pot of Manna, yet there is no neceſſity
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:53450:88"/>of any influence from one into the other, or of any thing to be poured out of one veſſell into another: but all that grace of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was ſtill preſerved and kept in the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall Law: and ſo no grace in the morall.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. If the Apoſtle did ſpeak as much againſt the ceremoniall, as morall Law, was it not becauſe the people had no further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect then to the act, obſervance, or thing done, reſting in the bare uſe, without faith in Chriſt, the onely treaſure hid, and propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in and by them? and ſo they made that to be worke, which was grace: and ſo no difference between ceremoniall and morall things.<note place="margin">Sincere accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        </note> And being thus perverted, the continuance and uſe of circumciſion and the ſacrifices did oppoſe Chriſt, and grace, though they did not ſo, as they were inſtituted and commanded by God to be uſed. Sacrifices and Sacraments be Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, which rightly underſtood and taken, and purely uſed, are not properly mans works, but Gods. He propoundeth and commendeth thereby unto us his grace, and the work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by Jeſus Chriſt, the ſole object that our faith is to look at, and to be exerciſed about in the uſe of them. If we handle them ſincerely, we bring no work, nothing for acceptation with God, but onely are receivers of what he freely giveth unto us. Its an eaſie and too common an errour to turn all into works, even Baptiſm and the Lords Supper, whereby the ſimple nature and verity of them is extinguiſhed and loſt. Chriſt profiteth none, but ſuch as deſpairing of Law and works, do by faith ſhe onely unto the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of his grace. If a man ſeek help or comfort in any one act, or work, he is then bound to ſeek the ſame in all the works of the Law, and ſo is a debter to fulfill the whole Law: and is quite fallen from grace: ſo is it <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.2, 3, 4. <hi>Behold I</hi> Paul <hi>ſay unto you, that if you be circumciſed</hi> (namely in that perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that that act will avail you any thing) <hi>Chriſt ſhall not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit you at all,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Laſtly, This ſay you hath been alway a ſtrong Argument to perſwade you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And there appeareth no ſtrength in it, but it is as weak, ſilly, and poor as any: and whereas you ſay, <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies,</hi> I underſtand you thus, <hi>viz.</hi> ſince you entertained that conceit, that the Law of works is a Covenant of grace: by a miſtake herein, you might be confirmed in that errour; but what
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:53450:88"/>bred or occaſioned that opinion at firſt? And we now having the ſame morall Law, how is it (if the ceremoniall be included in that ſecond Commandment) that it doth not bind us alſo to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, be circumciſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as it did the Jews? elſe we have not all in the Law.</p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Interpreters vary about the meaning of that Covenant-book, or Teſtament that was ſprinkled with blood, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. If you will contend it was the Law largely taken, even for what was delivered on <hi>Mount Sinai;</hi> In which large acceptation, that Law, blood of ſprinkling, and other ceremonies then uſed, were typicall, and ſhadows of future good things, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.1. then you exclude the Morall Law ſtrictly taken, as a rule of righteouſneſs; for it was not typicall. And now what have you gained by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this a Covenat of grace, which the Jews lived under? or where, or what grace is found in the morall Law? But when <hi>Moſes</hi> took the blood and ſprinkled it on the people, and ſaid, <hi>Behold the blood of the Covenant which the Lord hath made with you,</hi> Exod. 24.8. your Marginall note telleth you, It was to ſignifie, that the Law being broken by us, could alone be ſatisfied by the blood and death of Chriſt. Let <hi>Moſes</hi> be ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picall Mediatour, yet it followeth not, that it was not a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works, (if you take it for the Law morall) but contrarily, that it was no other: for a Mediator was therefore needfull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by the Law the people were convinced that there was diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and variance between God and them, in that they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be tranſgreſſors of that his Law, and the enmity was to be ſlain and aboliſhed, and a reconcilement made by a middle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. <label type="milestone">

                     <p>The reſidue of this Section, I leave as dubious and obſcure: of whom you mean, I know not.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>B. If the Law was that ſame Covenant, with that Oath God made to</hi> Iſaac, <hi>then it muſt needs be a Covenant of grace: But,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Therefore God remembers what he had promiſed to</hi> Abraham, Deut. 7.2. It ſhall come to paſs if ye
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:53450:89"/>hearken to theſe judgements, and do them, that the Lord thy God ſhall keep unto thee the Covenant and mercy which he ſware unto thy Fathers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Nothing is more evident by this place, then that the Law (requiring theſe judgements to be hearkened unto and done) was a diſtinct doctrine from that Covenant made with them in their Fathers. For, 1. God requires of them the doing of the one, but promiſes that he himſelf will keep the other, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and the mercy: ſo that this wholly reſts and relyeth on him. 2. He calls and commendeth himſelf firſt to be <hi>the Lord their God,</hi> not upon condition of their doing or obedience, but before he required it, and as the ground of commanding it. 3. The Covenant and mercy was made long before, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Oath in the dayes of their Fathers: theſe ſtand all in that text fully againſt you, and for us. Yet he dealing with them, as a Father with his Children, is willing to manifeſt his faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and love in keeping Covenant and promiſe made long before in that way of their obedience and dutifulneſs: but that he made that Covenant the ſame with the Law, is denied, as utterly falſe. If you ſay to your Child, he ſhall find you a loving and kind Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to him, ſo that he will be dutiful and obedient to you; now you are not his Father nor he your Child upon this condition, though in this way you may manifeſt and expreſs your affections at your pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>Now take a view of your ſix Arguments, and let us know what be your ſecond thoughts of them; and alſo your anſwer to thoſe places ſo fully meeting and oppoſing you in this your way, as the Angell did <hi>Balaam</hi> in his way, is infirm and nothing ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>B. If that in</hi> Gal. 3.18. <hi>and</hi> Rom. 4.14. <hi>be rigidly and univerſally true, then the doctrine of the</hi> Socinians <hi>would plainly prevail, who from theſe do urge there was no grace, nor faith, nor nothing of Chriſt vouchſafed unto the Jews, whereas they had the adoption, though their ſtate was a ſtate of bondage.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Truth is to be received in love to it, for it ſelf, though no errour nor danger (a thing impoſſible) ſhould be prevented by it. 2. If <hi>Socinians</hi> do urge thoſe places, to inferre, that no grace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        <pb n="161" facs="tcp:53450:89"/>come by the Law, but by the promiſe onely made and given long before; let us ſee how you would except againſt this: but both you and the <hi>Socinians</hi> are wide and deceived, though not in the ſame way. 3. They had the adoption indeed, but that was by faith in the promiſed ſeed: and the putting them under that pedagogy of <hi>Moſes</hi> made their ſtate ſo ſervile.</p>

                     <p>I Cannot ceaſe to muſe, that you ſo proſecute your matter in this large acception and ſenſe of the Law, knowing that the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is of the morall ſtrictly taken. You chuſe rather to keep the thickets and buſhes, then to appear in the open plains: we may gueſs why. Yet take notice, that the doctrine you raiſe doth not grow from your text, no not in your own expoſition: for you expound it of the Law of works ſtrictly taken, as it is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the Law of faith. But your doctrine you ſo frame and carry, as that you tell us, The Law, as a Covenant of grace given to the Iſraelites, in ſome ſenſe doth oppoſe the grace of the Goſpel: which aſſertion, ſuppoſe true, yet is no fruit of this tree; hath not its riſe from your text. 2. Being witty to coyne and deviſe things of your own head, without Scripture-ground, you ſay it is for this end, <hi>viz.</hi> To diſcover the nature of the Law and Goſpel; a fair pretence and promiſe, without reality of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance: for you rather cover and darken, then otherwiſe. 3. You bring in <hi>Calvin</hi> to little purpoſe, who diſtributes the Law into three kindes; and he doth not ſay that the morall Law differeth only from the Goſpel in regard of clearer manifeſtation, but deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it to have or contain any grace in it: and ſo in nature and kinde to differ from the Goſpel or word of grace, and not gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:53450:90"/>onely. And the like may be ſaid of <hi>Pareus.</hi> 4. You have often received what is thought of your ſo often ſod Coleworts, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented here again to the Reader: that they under the Law did enjoy grace, <hi>&amp;c. viz.</hi> that they had it not by the Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>B. That the doctrine of the Law, in the more preceptive nature of it may be compared with the doctrine of the Goſpel, having the grace of God axnexed to it, and going along with it: now this in ſome reſpects is an unequall compariſon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Why do you now more ſtraiten the Law then did <hi>Calvin,</hi> in that his teſtimony, who takes the Law for that rule of life, in which God requireth of us that which is his own, giving us no ground of hope unleſs in every reſpect we walke according to it? And you tell us of the Goſpel having the grace of God an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as if the Goſpel could be ſeparated from that grace, which is the ſubject matter of it: for doth the Goſpel ſpeak of, or hold forth unto us any thing elſe? beſide, the grace of God is ſo proper and peculiar to the Goſpel that not one word of it is mentioned in the Law: for the Law is of works, and the Goſpel is called the word of his grace. But perhaps you will ſay. By grace, you mean the ſpirit of life, that reneweth and quickeneth the ſoul; if you do ſo, yet it hath been cleared that although the Spirit do not alway, and in all, produce and work this work of renovation, yet the Goſpel is the ordinary inſtrument that is uſed for this, and not the Law. That expreſſion of yours <hi>(If you take the doctrine or letter of the Goſpel without the grace of God)</hi> is very improper: for it is, as if you could take the writing without the matter it ſpecifieth and entreateth of. Again, obſerve, that the difference between the letter of the Goſpel, and the letter of the Law (as you call them) is, in that the Law is ſaid then to kill, when the ſpirit worketh effectually by it: for then ſin reviveth in the conſcience, and ſo J died, ſaith <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7.9. and ſo the Commandment was found to be to death, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. but the Goſpel then killeth and leaveth in death and condemnation, when the ſpirit worketh not in the heart to receive and mingle it by faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.19. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. Your counſel is good, to make the parallel equal: but this is unequal in you, ſtill to make Law and Goſpel equally and alike the inſtrument of grace and life.</p>

                     <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> pag. 2, 3, 4. <hi>I come to the</hi> Antinomian <hi>difference, and there I finde ſuch a one, that I am confident was never heard of before. In</hi> Hony Comb, <hi>God, ſaith he, ſaw ſin in believers of the old Teſtament, but not in the new,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Our weakneſs makes us ſtumble and to be offended, where no cauſe is ſometime, and with too much confidence to condemn or reject ſuch pretious truths, as are received and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Children of wiſdome. I have ſpoken before to this phraſe. In ſobriety of mind, ponder this. The Scripture doth not ſay, that Chriſt did actually take and do away ſin, till he came and ſhed his blood for that purpoſe: and the object of their faith in the old Teſtament, was the promiſe of future good things, to be done and wrought by Chriſt when the fulneſs of time appointed came, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. ſo that God is ſaid to have pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in bearing with his people till he received full ſatisfaction, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. and this finiſhed and plenary work of redemption, that the Goſpel holdeth forth to us, was the object of their hope, who onely lived in a certain expectation of it, according to the promiſe: yet did that faith and hope both ſuſtain, ſave, and ſerve them ſufficiently according to that their condition, wherein it pleaſed the Father to place them. Their Goſpel in brief was, That Chriſt ſhould appear and take away ſin: ours now is, That he is come and hath done it: he loved us and hath waſhed us from our ſins, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. they had the promiſe of this; but we the performance. This might content an indifferent mind. The Sun of righteouſneſs was not riſen in their dayes, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.2. I hear of another of better abilities and helps, who is much ingaged in this controverſie, and hath promiſed to vindicate both the <hi>Hony Comb,</hi> and D. <hi>Criſp:</hi> I ſhall not prevent him.</p>
                     <p>What D. <hi>Criſp</hi> aſſerteth, is ſolid and clear; neither do you bring any thing of any great force to overthrow it. I perceive his Scriptures and reaſons to prove them two diſtinct Covenants, carry ſuch light and weight in them, that you have little mind to meddle with them. And to the judicious, yourdealing her is neither ſatisfactory nor ſon.</p>
                     <p>You tell of a heap of fulſhoods and much errour in few lines; but make not one truely to appear. Alſo you cannot juſtifie your charge afterward: for he ſaith not that all the legall ſacrifices were
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:53450:91"/>onely for ſinnes of meere ignorance: but alledging that place, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15.28. and <hi>ver.</hi> 20. <hi>The ſoul that ſinneth preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly ſhall dye: Here,</hi> ſaith the Doctor, is a ſacrifice for ſins of ignorance, but that ſoul that ſinneth preſumptuouſly ſhall dye, no ſacrifice for that. The Scripture is plain, and will bear him out, in all that he inferreth from it. See your many errours and miſtakes in this. 1. He ſaith, <hi>Here,</hi> Numb. 15.28. is a ſacrifice for ſins of ignorance; and ſo there is: but your charge is, that he ſaith, <hi>All legall Sacrifices</hi> were for ſins of meer igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. 2. That they were onely for thoſe ſins. 3. You put in the word <hi>meer,</hi> which he uſeth not: Is this candid, or as a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter? let me aske, Was there not divers ſinnes, for which no ſacrifices could be admitted? and againe, was not pardon of ſin ſued out upon thoſe ſacrifices that God required? If you grant thoſe two, as the evidence of truth in them will prevail and inforce ſo farre, then I ſee no cauſe herein to except againſt the Doctor.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> Obj. <hi>Chriſt the true ſatifice was repreſented in every ſacrifice, and all the vertue and benefit to come from Chriſts blood: and then could not that take away all ſin, as well as ſome?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> It's true, Chriſt was repreſented, and ſufficient vertue from his blood to take away that ſin the party then was guilty of, and was troubled with: but the blood of Chriſt was not held out in every particular ſacrifice, to expiate all ſins preſent, paſt, and to come, as in the time of the Goſpel. Even as the brazen ſerpent was erected to cure as they were wounded, and in the ſenſe of their fear and ſmart made uſe of it: therefore you are too raſh in ſaying, Unleſs the <hi>Antinomian</hi> Author were a <hi>Socinian,</hi> he can never expedite himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>B. In the new Teſtament is there not the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, for which no pardon is promiſed?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> What is this againſt the Doctor, or to the point in hand? The Doctor ſpeaketh of the ſins of the Elect of God: (for who elſe receive forgiveneſs?) and of the manner of Gods diſpenſing par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to them, how differing it was from this under the Goſpel; but the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt is unpardonable, and therefore the Elect are kept from falling into it.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, as I conceive, The differences which the Doctor
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:53450:91"/>inſiſteth on, are to be underſtood in regard of the application of the ſacrifice and blood of Chriſt, and that not onely on mans part through faith; but on Gods part alſo, in his Ordinances and manner of adminiſtration. The Apoſtle in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> brings all, or the main and moſt differences between the Churches ſtate, before and after Chriſts death, unto the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the conſcience, which could not be peaceable, comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and joyfull under the old Teſtament, becauſe there was ſtill on Gods part new remembrance of ſin, and ſo alſo ſacrifices ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be offered upon the commiſſion of freſh and new ſinnes. And God did not appear unto them, neither could they in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſo receive and apprehend him, as actually ſatisfied and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, till after their ſacrifices: but now Chriſt by one ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and offering of himſelf, hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctified; ſo there is no remembrance of ſin, for God hath ſaid, that in his Son he is well pleaſed, and that for ever.</p>
                     <p>So that the oppoſition is not onely as you ſay, between Chriſt and thoſe legall ſacrifices, being conſidered and uſed without him, or without faith in his blood: (for ſo they were effectuall to take away no ſin at all, whenas yet it is ſaid in many places of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that they did, though not to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of the conſcience, in that there was a remembrance of ſin again) but it is evident to be between the eſtate of the Church in the dayes of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and now after Chriſts reſurrection, which is the time of reformation: Chriſt by his eternal ſpirit having offered himſelf without ſpot to God by his blood, to purge the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from dead works to ſerve the living God. And hereby all may ſee how inſolid, impertinent, and vain all your reply is. Firſt, The blood of Chriſt in the vertue and efficacy of it, did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend and reach unto thoſe times alſo, and did cleanſe from all ſin; but God did ſo carry it, that he was pleaſed to reveal and apply this his grace unto them as they needed. All pardons by Chriſt were purchaſed which they had; but theſe unſearchable riches of forgiveneſs, peace, favour, adoption, and inheritance were manifeſted and diſpenſed by ſome and ſome, as Fathers do things of worth by ſmall pittances at once unto their Children. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, It's true, in this is no difference between the faithfull <hi>Jews</hi> then, and Chriſtians now, that all the good God did to
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:53450:92"/>either was onely for his own names ſake, and no good in them, and ſo are prevented by him, in being made his people freely and of free grace. Yet while God did govern his Church under the Law, moſt of his favours and good thing, he (after they became his) did tender, diſpenſe, and communicate, upon antecedent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. So that although they were Children and free, yet their ſtate and manner of education was ſervile. And in the way of their obedience therefore they received their peace, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience whereof gave them boldneſs towards God. And yet if God veiled his Paternity, graciouſneſs, and favour, as ſomtimes Parents do not ſhew the like pleaſant countenance to their Children, when they have not carried themſelves dutifully, It will not follow then, that God ceaſeth to love them, but is wiſe in the opportune manifeſtation of his love. Thus it is a perpetuall truth indeed, That Chriſts ſacrifice was as efficacious to thoſe before his death, as thoſe after, <hi>viz.</hi> to procure and purchaſe all things neceſſary to ſalvation: but theſe treaſures being in the Fathers keeping, he did diſpoſe and diſpenſe them as he pleaſed, more ſparingly then, then now.</p>

                     <p>WHatever your reaſon or ends may be for it, yet I ſee not any good or warrantable ground thus to take and handle the Law and Goſpel in a large ſenſe, as you ſay: and when you have done. I would know what of the Goſpel you conceive to be legall, and how much Law you take to be Evangelicall. Alſo you prefixe a Text as your foundation, but the diſcourſe you erect doth not touch it, is not at all ſupported by it, but ſtands like a Caſtle built in the Air. Neither do I find the <hi>Lutherans</hi> poſing the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> about the Law in this: for both affirm the Law to be a Covenant of works, and ſuperadded to the promiſe; holding forth all favour and peace upon ſuch hard
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:53450:92"/>conditions to the <hi>Jews,</hi> that they might experimentally be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of their folly in ſeeking it by their own righteouſneſs. You muſt go over it again, elſe what is done will not ſerve to prove <hi>Moſes</hi> Law a Covenant of grace. Indeed we grant the godly <hi>Jews</hi> did enjoy what Chriſt premiſed: but it was by ſuch Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances as were of grace, and not of works, as is the Law: they eyed or looked at Chriſt in the promiſes, and not in precepts.</p>
                     <p>And as you began, ſo you proceed; laying down differences, not between the Law and Goſpell, but between Goſpel and Goſpel, I mean the adminiſtration of grace before and now, of which others have writ more particularly, plainly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably. Then you tell us, They <hi>Jews</hi> had a twofold conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, 1. as being ſervile; another as being Sons, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der age. Now that is it that we ſay, As Sons they were free, for they were ſo by Chriſt promiſed; but their condition was ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile, and their immunities and priviledges were in a great part vailed and kept from them.</p>
                     <p>But note that the Moſaicall pedagogy is antiquated: what need was it to handle law or Goſpel otherwiſe then in their ſtrict and proper ſenſe? To run over every thing, is long and tedious. What is ſaid by you of theſe differences, may be granted with theſe two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions; firſt, that the law ſtrictly taken, is not as you ſay, onely for thoſe who have a perfect and holy nature; <hi>Paul</hi> doth directly croſs and contradict it, ſaying, <hi>The Law is not made for the righteous, but for the Lawleſs and diſobedient.</hi> 1 Tim. 1.9. And <hi>Adam</hi> was not charged with this law in his integrity, but had a Law touching a thing in its own nature indifferent: for the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this law was then naturall to him, as is flying to a Bird, and bearing fruit to a Tree, or Hearbe. Alſo it is clear that the law was added becauſe of tranſgreſſion, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19. as, if there had been no ſinne, there ſhould have been no occaſion of giving the law. And this contradicts your ſelf elſewhere, affirming the Law to be an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall inſtrument to regenerate and ſanctifie. Now who needs to be regenerated and ſanctified? he that hath a perfect and holy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or he that is a ſinner and impure? if you think otherwiſe, what a deceiver are you, when you would perſwade the filthy and the vile, that they may be changed and renewed by the Law of works? And thus as your fourth difference is utterly falſe, ſo your third
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:53450:93"/>is found to be defective, and not plenary: for all is of grace. It is the Goſpel or word of grace that juſtifieth and ſanctifieth. God in that miniſtration we live under, is <hi>a free giver;</hi> and man, <hi>a meer receiver:</hi> for God having diſcovered and made bare the root and heart of man, ſo as he ſeeth his ſpirituall poverty and wretchedneſs by his Law, doth then open his graciouſneſs and his bountifull hand by his Goſpel, that the believing ſoul may be ſatisfied with his goodneſs in every kinde. So that now as a Beggar he muſt live by Almes of Divine liberality, being thus made to walk humbly with his God. <hi>Open thy mouth, and I will fill it,</hi> Pſa. 81.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And in your laſt difference, you ſet up and pull down, ſay and unſay. At firſt you tell us, The Law is conditionall, but the Goſpel abſolute: but this is too clear a ground for you to abide upon: therefore preſently you ſay, <hi>I finde this queſtion a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome one.</hi> Thus you trouble your ſelf and others without cauſe. Repentance and faith are no Goſpel-conditions, but are ſaid to be the reaſon and end of the preaching of the Goſpel: It is preached that men may repent and believe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.26. <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.47. yea, and that they may be holy too, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.22. Secondly, The Goſpel is the ſeed of them all, as is to be cleared afterward: they all grow and ariſe out of the doctrine of grace: how then can they be conditions of it? for what is a condition, but that which is neceſſarily required that a thing may be ſo? ſo that it will follow: It is no Goſpel, where there is no faith or repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or at leaſt none preached to me. What am I called upon to believe then? The Goſpel is the object of faith, and in believing are we ſaid to receive and obey it, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.8. The Goſpel offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth pardon, favour and eteruall life to ſinners, that they may come, receive, and partake of all freely; yea, beſeeches men to be reconciled; And doth not bid them go and get repentance, and faith, and holineſs elſewhere, as they can: and then upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition they bring theſe, they ſhall be forgiven all their ſins, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled and ſaved by the Goſpel. Indeed where God maketh the Goſpel to be effectual, there it bringeth forth theſe fruits, there is repentance and ſaith to believe: and it giveth no peace nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation to any, but the believing ſoul: ſo as faith is after the hearing of the Goſpel, ſo comfort is after faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.13.
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:53450:93"/>
                        <hi>The God of all hope fill you full of peace and joy in belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</hi> In order one precedes another. Goſpel is preached be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Faith, that men may believe: and then comes peace and conſolation upon believing. But who would argue hence, that Faith is a condition of the Goſpel, or Peace a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Faith? They denote a certaine Order, that God is pleaſed to ſet and obſerve in his works and diſpenſations.</p>
                     <p>As for Mortification and Sanctification you ſpeak of, they are the effects of the Goſpel: for the ſoul thereby called and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted into Chriſt, beginneth to dye unto all things, and to live only unto Chriſt and God in him; ſo increaſing with the increaſings of God, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.19.</p>

                     <p>IF this Queſtion, Whether the Goſpel preach Repentance or no, be as you affirme the foundation of Antinomaniſme, It then much concerneth you in this to play the man, that the foundation being razed, all may fall to confuſion: and this the rather alſo, in that you ſay, that this made the great commotion at firſt, between the Orthodox and the <hi>Antinomians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Before I entermeddle with this diſpute, let me deliver my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Which is, That Repentance cannot be ſaid properly to be the doctrine of the Law: and yet the Law is not by this wholly excluded, as you ſay it is by the old <hi>Antinomians:</hi> whom you mean, or what their Tenets were, I know not, neither think it much material. I ſhall love the truth in any, and maintain them no further. Now my inducement hereunto is, becauſe the Law never mentioneth Repentance, nor hath any word to exhort and call
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:53450:94"/>thereunto. It worketh indeed preparatorily in the ſoul, by reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſin and miſery, ſo as a man findeth himſelf undone, without help or hope, in great diſtreſs: but this is not Repentance: for here Man is a Patient, being convinced ſubdued and brought in his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit under the work of the Law. And this may well be called the former Mortification, which is not of ſin in Man, but in the Man for ſin, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.11. But to repent is an act, a thing to be done, put upon man being plunged into this great depth of woe and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, as a hopeful and initial mean to obtain mercy, pardon and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: this is clear to me, from <hi>Act.</hi> 2.37, 38. Where thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> being beaten down, and exceedingly terrified in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of that horrid fact, <hi>the killing of the Lord of Life,</hi> and crying out as ſinking in deſpair for advice and councell, preſently <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid unto them, <hi>Repent,</hi> &amp;c. whence I collect with <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe,</hi> that all that former ſight and ſence of ſin and legall ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour was no part of Repentance: It was yet to begin: yea, and ſecondly, It was preſcribed as the firſt courſe to be taken, with hope of recovery. Not that Repentance was in their or any mans power; for it is God that giveth it, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.25, 26.3. None are bid to <hi>Repent,</hi> without a promiſe of mercy annexed withall to move him to it; which promiſe holding forth the grace of the Goſpel, is doubtleſs firſt hearkened unto, received and credited: and ſo the burthened conſcience conceiving now a good hope through Faith in this promiſe, begins to repent and ſeek unto the Lord. Hence <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, chap. 55.7. <hi>Let the wicked man return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him: and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.</hi> and Joel 2.13. <hi>Rent your hearts, and not your garments, and turne to the Lord your God, for he is gracious and mercifull,</hi> &amp;c. So that to me it is clear, that in order of nature the doctrine that holdeth forth the graciouſneſs of the Name and nature of God in Chriſt, (in whom he is propitious) ought firſt to be publiſhed; both becauſe our conceits naturally are, that God will not favour and receive ſinners, but the juſt and good are they onely, unto whom the promiſes of acceptance and bleſſing do belong: And alſo in that God, in that Miniſtry of the Law, hath already ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared unto the dejected ſoul in another forme, and under a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary notion, revealing wrath, threatning a caſting off, and ſhutting
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:53450:94"/>up all mercies in diſpleaſure againſt it becauſe of ſin; for how elſe poſſibly can theſe naturall and inbred conceits and imaginations of God be raiſed out of the mind, and the ſoul be perſwaded, that notwithſtanding and beyond all that it apprehends of God in his Law, and is become ſenſible of, yet there is hope of mercy, forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and redemption with the Lord? So that the effectuall and immediate incentive and introduction to repentance, and turning to God, is the promiſe of Grace by Jeſus Chriſt. When <hi>Benhadad</hi> King of <hi>Syria</hi> and his ſervants being in great ſtrait and danger of loſing their lives conſidered what they had heard of the Kings of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> how that they were mercifull; ſee their humble reſolution. <hi>Let us put (ackcloth on our loynes, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the King of</hi> Iſrael, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 20.31. But on the other ſide, <hi>Adam</hi> not ſo conceiving of God, out of the inward privity of his diſobedience, and being then altogether ignorant of any mercy to be ſhewed by God in that way, that afterward God acquainted him with; he in ſtead of repenting and falling down in a ſorrowfull confeſſion of what he had done, and crying <hi>peccavi,</hi> In his inward horrour and fear ranne away, hid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and then would fain have excuſed the matter. Now if the way be thus freely ſet open for all, he that comes not in is inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable: and he that deſireth may come: but this is not, that any ſoul ſhould reſt contented with hearing that it may be freely welcome; but that it come indeed, and ſo it find an effectuall entrance into that ſtate and kingdom of Grace: for too many do hover, and dally with theſe weighty things: and the inward ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours ceaſing to purſue the ſoul to the utmoſt, the bare know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and having of the letter of this word of Grace ſufficeth them, being never truly converted, healed, and comforted. And this is the main reaſon of their hankering after the legall way, for a ſupply of what they want, or of turning this Grace into wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                     <p>So that I cannot but marvell, that you, or any experienced Chriſtian ſhould ſo oppoſe D. <hi>Criſp,</hi> (whom the Lord raiſed up, and uſed as a choice inſtrument to open this free way to poor ſinners, that if God had given them a heart to come, whatever their ſins were, they might come and welcome, and nor be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected nor denied what they defired) as if his doctrine were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:53450:95"/>repentance; whereas it tendeth to breed and bring forth true Repentance, not to be repented of. I had thought to have writ a Treatiſe onely upon this Subject, ſeeing how oppoſite mens minds are to that ſo acceptable truth of God. Who will ſeek unto him that ſmiteth him, humbling, and caſting down himſelf at the foot of the Lord willingly, if he do not firſt hear and know, that God pardoneth iniquity, and delighteth in ſhewing mercy? God draweth the froward heart of man with the Cords of his love, and overcometh his evill and rebellious nature, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and commending his kindneſs, even as afterward he fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth their heart, and putteth his own into the ſame way, to follow him in labouring to overcome evill with good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.21. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.1, 2.</p>
                     <p>And laſtly, who will not be contented to be numbered amongſt tranſgreſſors, yea and willingly ſit down with the greateſt and chiefe of ſinners, when he heareth that God is mercifull to ſinners, juſtifieth the ungodly, and where ſinne aboundeth, maketh his Grace to abound the more? thereby taking occaſion to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt and magnifie his graciouſneſs in the eyes of all the World, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.6. By this you may ſee ſtill, that the Law excludes and keeps out the ſinful ſoul: and that it may convert and turne unto God, the word of his Grace onely is to be preached. Now I come to conſider what you write.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>B. The word [repentance] is taken ſomtime largely, and ſomtime ſtrictly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> By what is ſaid, It is apparent that repentance may be taken, as it is often, for the whole turning to God, becauſe after the ſoul apprehending its danger, and ſeeing no hope of ſafety any way elſe, yet hearing what is reported of Gods Grace in Chriſt, to poor, wretched and loſt ſinners; It is moved, drawn &amp; perſwaded (through the hand and mean of Faith taking hold hereon) to repent, and cry unto God for mercy and pardon: ſo that ſorrow and tears ariſing from the ſight of his forlorn condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is but the pining away in their iniquities, doth haſten death, and to tend utter deſpair.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Your ſecond poſition, as it may be conſtrued, ſhall paſs now; ſomwhat being before to like effect, and the ſubſerviency of the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:53450:95"/>Law as preparatory being now granted by you.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Your third conceit is ambiguouſly and confuſedly ſet down; but enough hath been ſaid about it, <hi>viz.</hi> That neither repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, nor the Faith of the Elect can be ſaid to be wrought by the Law. As for that legall Faith you mention, it may be in a Reprobate, and of it ſelf it is the mother and breeder of deſpair. If you or others will have a legal repentance, meaning thereby that conviction, fear, or trouble wrought by the Law when it reviveth ſin, or at moſt ſuch as is aſcribed to <hi>Judas,</hi> from whom by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward force and violence was ſqueezed out that confeſſion, <hi>I have ſinned,</hi> &amp;c. by a heavy hand upon his conſcience, as to clear the innocency of Chriſt, ſo partly may be in hope by that venting, to find ſome eaſe and mitigation of anguiſh within: (which yet is not that in queſtion) I ſhall not much contend about words: ſo we accord in the thing: but then you are to know, this is <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>Alſo beſides that Faith or perſwaſion of mercy in God accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his promiſe, there is alſo another ſpeciall Faith after the ſoul is come in to God, which is an effectuall that the parties ſins are done away, God reconciled, and he accepted: and ſo this being the end of his coming, his deſire is ſatisfied; and now followeth, as it is called, another Repentance upon this, for now the love of God entreth, and is ſhed out into the ſoul by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> which doth marvellouſly refreſh and ſtabliſh the heart, and renew and inflame it with love reciprocal unto God, who hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in ſuch mercy and kindneſs: and thus is the ſoul in love gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and given up to be the Lords, and to ſerve him in holineſs and righteouſneſs without fear all the days of his life: thus <hi>Luke</hi> 7. ſhe loved much in affection and expreſſion, who had received for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of many ſins: and this renovation and change of mind, doth farre exceed your legall reformation, which you ſo much preſs and ſtand for.</p>

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbeliefe is a ſin againſt the Law, as well as againſt the Goſpel. The Goſpel declareth the object of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Faith, but law condemns for not believing in him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> I queſtion whether the Law condemn for poſitive infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, or for not believing in Chriſt. Under favour, I am of that
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:53450:96"/>mind, that the Law onely condemneth for the not believing or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying of thoſe things which the Law propoundeth. Now the Law propounds not Chriſt to be believed on: beſides, your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is, that Chriſt is to be propounded to none, but the broken in ſpirit, the penitent, and I know not how otherwiſe qualified. And I ſee not then but the Law ſhould condemne for not being broken and penitent firſt, and for not believing after. I confeſs the ſame God requireth Faith to whatſoever he ſhall ſpeak by Law or Goſpel; but by the Law I can be bound onely to believe thoſe things the Law declareth unto me. Legall doctrine requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a Legall, but not an Evangelicall Faith. Whatever the Law ſaith, it ſaith it to them that are under the Law: But you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent us with much ſtrange divinity; ſo this is moſt uncouth to me, and untrue, That the Law ſhould be enlightned by the Goſpel, and ſo faſten a new Command upon us: how differeth this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion from that of theirs, who ſay, Chriſt added to the Law? which you ſay yet is infected with <hi>Socinian</hi> poyſon, page 243.</p>

                     <p>

What foul errour is this, if prejudice be not? 2. He ſpeaketh of Legall obedience,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:53450:96"/>ſuch as was this their zeal in ſeeking to eſtabliſh their own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs: and you tell of ſincerity taken for the truth of grace, whereby the ſoul is freely ſubjected to the Goſpel, and ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to the righteouſneſs thereof (for ſo I would fain underſtand you) which is paſſive, and not active: thus farre then you are wide.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> pag. 257. <hi>I ſhall explain that place,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.7. <hi>becauſe it may be wreſted by the</hi> Antinomian, <hi>as if the law were to be abrogated.</hi>

                     <p n="2">2. You give an undue expoſition, but explain not, but rather do involve the place in greater obſcurity: for, ſay you, —</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>B. The intent of the Apoſtle is to ſhew the excellency of the Miniſtery of the Goſpel, above that of the Law, and that in three reſpects,</hi> 1. <hi>In regard one is the Miniſtery of death and condemnation, the other of life and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, therefore one called Letter, the other Spirit: which you muſt underſtand warily, taking the Law nakedly, without the Spirit of God, and the Goſpel with the Spirit: for as</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za <hi>obſerveth, Goſpel without Gods Spirit, is alſo the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of death,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and what good is wrought by the Law, it cometh from the Spirit of Chriſt.</hi> 2. <hi>In regard of continuance. The Miniſtery of</hi> Moſes, <hi>underſtanding it of the Jewiſh pedagogy, was to be aboliſhed: not the Morall part, which ſtill obligeth Chriſtians: but Goſpel abideth for ever.</hi> 3. <hi>In regard of glory, God cauſed ſome material glory to ſhine upon</hi> Moſes, <hi>&amp;c. but what cometh by the Goſpel, is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual.</hi>

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:53450:97"/>is eaſie to gather that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh not of the Ceremoniall,<note place="margin">Impreſſum &amp; inſculptum; ex hoc locoiſacile colligitur <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum,</hi> non agere de Ceremoniis, ſed de ipſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calego. <hi>B.</hi>

                     <p n="2">2 Your words imply, that there is no difference in truth and ſtrict ſence, between Law and Goſpel, ſo that the Spirit be taken with them both; which directly contradicteth the Apoſtle, who cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth one <hi>the Miniſtery of death and condemnation,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>of life and righteouſneſs:</hi> for the Spirit working by the Law, doth kill and condemn, and therefore is alſo called a Spirit <hi>of boudage,</hi> Rom. 8.15. but the Spirit by the Goſpel quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth and giveth life, being a Spirit of Adoption and liberty. The Spirit is one and the ſame, but the Miniſtrations be different: and ſo are the effects produced by either.

                        </gap>e the Law is called the Miniſtery of Life, as if Chriſt did uſe it to convey and give Life. Alſo to ſay that the Spirit quickeneth by the Law, is to enforce a ſenſe flatly againſt the Apoſtle. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver your expreſſions do make the place more obſcure &amp; dark, in tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us that the Goſpel alſo without Gods Spirit, is the Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of death, becauſe it is as impoſſible to believe, as to obey the Law. Whereas <hi>Paul</hi> therefore calleth the Goſpel the Miniſtration of righteouſneſs and life, in that the Spirit thereby begetteth faith in the hearts of the Elect, whereby they come to righteouſneſs and life. So <hi>Piſcator.</hi> The Law then having the Spirit working by it, killeth, as we ſee in <hi>Paul. Rom.</hi> 7. But the Goſpel maketh alive, juſtifying all the Elect of God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. You fail much in your ſecond reſpect alſo, for 1. as is proved and cleared, that the oppoſition is chiefly between the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Law, and the Goſpel. 2 However in a proper and true ſenſe the Law is done away in the kingdom of Chriſt, yet where infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity is, the Law remaineth: but where the word of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and life is, there can the Miniſtery of ſin and death have no place, even no more then the darkneſs of midnight hath at noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day: but ſpirituall things are ſpiritually diſcerned.</p>

You are in a golden dream.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>B. When there ſhall be a reformation, and truth break forth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>then thoſe corrupt Teachers, who would poyſon men, ſhould be diſcovered, and be of leaſt, that is, of no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</hi>

And if your dream be true, look to your ſelf.

But the Church, the Truth, and quarrell is Gods.

                     </p>
                     <p>Read Iſa. 66.5. <hi>Hear the word of the Lord ye that trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at his word: Your Brethren that have caſt you out for my Names ſake, ſaid, Let the Lord be glorified: but he ſhall

                     <p>Mr. <hi>B. They overthrow the law, when they hold ſuch prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples that will neceſſarily by way of conſequence inferre the abrogation of the Law. And thus though ſome</hi> Antinomians <hi>do expreſly and boldly aſſert the aboliſhing of it, at leaſt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. Yet others,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>diſclaiming it, held ſuch aſſertions as neceſſarily inferre the abrogation of it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> You cannot prove and make it appear, that any do aſſert the aboliſhing of it; ſo it may be taken for a ſlander and falſe accuſation. 2. In way of correction, as having overſhot your ſelf, and would eat ſome of your Words, You ſay, <hi>At leaſt to believers.</hi> Now firſt, What need believers a Law? ſo farre as believers, they live by Faith, and walke by Faith, yea and warre by Faith. 2. The Law affordeth nothing to nouriſh or ſupply any defect in the Chriſtians Faith. 3. Yet you nor none can directly and duely inferre hence, that they do abrogate the Law: ſo much now to vindicate them. But to returne your words upon your ſelf. I think that you do hold ſuch principles that neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily by way of conſequence, at leaſt, do abrogate the Law, yea, and make void repentance in great part after Faith is come, and bring in carnal ſecurity and a falſe peace into the ſoul; for one prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of yours is. That direction and obligation to obedience be the ſole eſſential conſtitutes of the law. So that that which condemneth, juſtifies, promiſeth and threatneth, is not properly the Law: but it hath been not onely aſſerted, but proved already, that theſe are as aſſential to a Law as the former. Again, What will you call that which doth condemn, and promiſe favour and peace to the good, if it be not Law? I am ſure it is no Goſpel: have you a third name for it? 2. Whence have theſe power to condemn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if no Law be in them? The Scripture faith, The Law doth curſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal wrath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I argue thus: Whoſoever denieth the Law a power to condemn and juſtifie, he deſtroyeth the Law: But Mr. <hi>Burg.</hi> denieth this to the Law: Therefore Mr. <hi>B.</hi> deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and abrogateth the Law, and ſo is the true <hi>Antinomian,</hi> and leaſt in the kingdom of God. This is ſo plain, that I leave it to
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:53450:98"/>your conſideration, with what hath been ſaid formerly. In the next place you ſay, The Law hath power over a believer, to direct, command, and oblige to duty, but not to condemn. Now I reply, Suppoſe a believer hath no will nor diſpoſition to obey in ſome things, or at ſomtimes; hath the Law no further power to threaten and condemn? then the Law will ſoon become an <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſops</hi> block, vilified and brought into contempt. Alſo grant a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever having the ſpirit, is freely diſpoſed and willing to obey, yet his obedience will be but partial and defective: and if then the Law have no power to accuſe and threaten in that way of new obedience, he may truſt henceforth in his own works, have his peace in that way of duty, (and not by his Faith in Chriſt) and thus grow ſelf-conſident and ſecure: but <hi>Paul</hi> who conſented to the Law, delighted in it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet in that he attained not to that perfect righteouſneſs of it, cryed out, <hi>Oh wretched man that I am,</hi> Rom 7.24. And if the curſe be now gone to a believer, from the Law, what further uſe or need hath he of his juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of the preſerving and maintaining his continual peace onely thereby? Laſtly, Confeſſion of ſin, ſelf-humiliation, ſelf-judging and condemning the accounting of our own righteouſneſs as dung, the fear of it, and the conſtant deſire to be ſtill found in Chriſt, not having our own righteouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> theſe will have no more place in us. What need <hi>Noah</hi> to keep in the Ark, if there be no drowning waters without? what need Chriſt a refuge or protection, where no power of the Law is to purſue, nor no danger to be feared?</p>
                     <p>Theſe and many ſuch like be the conſequences and fruit of your doctrine or aſſertions. And note, that either to curſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is not ſo much as an Iota or tittle of the Law, (a hard thing to affirm, much more to prove) or you offer too much violence to the good and inviolable law of God, in daring to part and ſeperate theſe from the Law every whit of it being imperiſhable: and incur that danger your ſelf, as <hi>Mal.</hi> 5.17, 18. Yet you have ſuch an evil eye and ſpite againſt us, that you ſay, pag. 269.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>B. The</hi> Antinomians <hi>do more fall againſt this text then any, who teach the diſobligation, not onely of the leaſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, but of the whole Law.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The contrary is apparently true, let the judicious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:53450:99"/>Reader, looking through all our diſcourſe hitherto, judge how untrue and unreaſonable your charge is. The law bindeth continually to duty and to the curſe for the leaſt failing: And faith unceſſantly acquitteth and looſeth, ſetteth free the ſoul, like thoſe two keys which Chriſt left to his Church to continue with it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the end. In the law I am bound, in faith ſet free.</p>
                     <p>M. B. <hi>It argueth impudency of thoſe who would make</hi> Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>on their ſide becauſe of his</hi> 6. <hi>diſputations againſt the Antinomians.</hi>

And whoſe thoſe ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Propoſitions were, that you have ſo collected, I know not: but with a good conſtruction, divers of them may be received and juſtified. And are held affirmatively by ſuch as are not ſuſpected guilty of Antinomianiſme.</p>
                     <p>You ſpare not ſtill to take and ſcrape together what you can to make us odious, that we may be utterly caſhiered; ſaying, <hi>Luther</hi> calleth thoſe <hi>Hoſtes legis organa Satanae, quid furores Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomorum:</hi> their doctrine is more to be taken heed of, then Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts.

But I ſee great mercy from the Lord ſhining through this thick and dark cloud of your malice. You are witneſſes to your ſelves, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>That ye are the children of them who killed the Prophets — Fill ye up then the meaſure of your Fathers,</hi> Mat. 23.31, 33.</p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> And ſtill no Error can come to light. 2. The Proverb is true, <hi>You muſe, as you uſe.</hi> I think your ordinary, or Pulpit-di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, is more groſſe, or not ſo pure, as we finde you here: and
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:53450:99"/>yet upon you review, this may be reproveable. If your you can ſee in ſecret, you may judge what is done in ſecret, as God doth; elſe, <hi>De ſecret is now judicat Eceleſia.</hi>

                     <p>M. B. <hi>The Author of the Aſſert. of grace diſclaims the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion againſt the law, yet there affirmes ſuch principles, from whence this concluſion will neceſſarily follow.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is but your conceit of ſuch a concluſion: to make it indeed, you muſt be forced to add of your owne unto the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes: but proceed to juſtifie your Accuſation.</p>
                     <p>M. B. <hi>For firſt, he makes no real difference either in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, or uſe of words, between the law reigning and ruling; ſo that if the Law rule a man it ruleth over him: now then they deny the law to reign over a believer, therefore they muſt needs hold it cannot be a rule.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> If your Adverſary ſay there is no real difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween reigning and ruling. It is your part, who oppoſe him, to make the difference appear by Scripture, or ſome way elſe: but this you do in no place, ſo often as you repeat it; which maketh me thinke verily you cannot. And you are not of that credit with me, that your bare word can carry it. Yet ſince you thus ſlightly paſs over that which you make the main ground of your oppſition, and this failing all you ſay falleth to nothing; I yet ſhall add a little, to occaſion and provoke more diligence and better inquiſition here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. 1. I argue thus. To grant or leave unto God onely a power to rule in his law, and to deny him the reigning power, is to make God in his law like an inferiour Magiſtrate, who hath no Sovereignty by right aſcribed to him. 2. That God maketh, and impoſeth his law with ſuch a command to be obeyed in it, doth argue his Sovereignty in his law, and mans ſubjection to him in it, as his Sovereign. But. 3. In the Scripture-language and uſe, I finde no difference between them. Pſal. 103.19. It is
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:53450:100"/>ſaid, <hi>The Lord hath prepared his throne in heaven, and his kingdome ruleth over all.</hi> Is not this all one with <hi>Reigneth?</hi> Pſal. 110.2. God ſaith to Chriſt, <hi>Rule thou in the midſt of thine enemies.</hi> As did he not rule and reigne as Lord and King? ſee Luke 19.14. <hi>We will not have this man reign over us:</hi> and verſe 27. <hi>Thoſe mine enemies, that would not have me reign over them, bring hither, and ſlay them before me;</hi> which is meant of Chriſt, whom the Father appointed to be ruler over all; to that in ruling, he reigneth: and they be indifferently uſed ſtill. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20:33. <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord ſurely with a mighty hand with a ſtretched-out arm, and with fury poured out will I rule over you.</hi> Here is the word <hi>Rule,</hi> and yet dominion and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty in ruling unto the utmoſt extent. Alſo <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.27. &amp; 19. 15. <hi>He ſhall rule them with a rod of iron:</hi> doth God rule, where he reigneth not? Its a ſtrange conceit, and a bold aſſertion of you and Doctor <hi>T.</hi> let it vaniſh as the ſmoke. The law hath a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and ſo hath Grace another: if we can diſcerne, and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the one from the other, we need not to leſſen the power of either. Laſtly, And in what ſenſe it is ſaid the law doth not reign over a believer, in the ſame, and no other may it be ſaid, the law doth not rule him: but this is not becauſe either reigning or ruling power be taken from the law; but that in a true and proper ſenſe, the Scripture affirmeth the believer not to be under the law, but under Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. He that knoweth not this myſtery, cannot ſtand faſt in that liberty, wherewith Chriſt hath made him free, nor endure in temptation.</p>
                     <p>You onely and vainly repeat what you read, but conſute no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; there is reaſon why: As you do not like, ſo you cannot oppoſe the clear truth: your ſpirits fail you; yet add to that you bring in out of D. <hi>T.</hi> That a Chriſtian by Chriſt is freed from the law, and alſo freed to it, to love it live and walk in it. In regard of that righteouſneſs and ſalvation he ſtandeth in with God which is the object of his faith, he is freed from it: but in regard of his holy and unblamable converſation and life here below, Chriſt by his Spirit doth ſet free and enlarge the heart actively to run the way of Gods commandments, ſo that yet in walking accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this rule, he is not ruled by the law, but by the Spirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in proceeding from Chriſt, unto whom he ſtands in ſubjection, as
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:53450:100"/>unto his Soveraign Lord and King.</p>
                     <p>I hope you will now be ſatisfied, and the world too, at leaſt ſo far as to account of us no more for Antinomians. If any thing yet be darke, we muſt conſider the Goſpel is a great myſtery.</p>
                     <p>You might well have kept in thoſe reviling and hateful words, or have been better adviſed ere you had ſhot ſo reproachful ſpeeches: though they be Arrowes taken from the quivers of other men, yet is it, that you might vent ſome ſpite by them: and when they return, you will finde the point of them towards your ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Then you give Antidotes, where there is no danger of infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. If any need them, he may uſe them in ſtead of better.</p>
                     <p>M. B. <hi>He ſets up free grace and Chriſt, not who names it often his book, or in pulpit, but whoſe heart is inwardly and deeply affected with it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> A private Chriſtian, not gifted to preach or print, may be more affected with it, then the Miniſter; and yet not ſo ſet it up in the hearts of others, for want of thoſe means of communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 2. Out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth ſpeaketh. If you were inwardly more affected with this doctrine, you would preach and commend it more, then any other, as <hi>Paul,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to know nothing but Chriſt Cruciſied:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.2. Phil. 1.20.</note> and ſought that he might be magnified, whether by his life or death: the main ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his miniſtery was the unſearchable riches in Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 8. Conſider theſe words of <hi>Luther,</hi> in his preface to the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> In my heart this one Article reigneth, even the faith of Chriſt, from whom, by whom, and unto whom, all my divine ſtudies day and night have recourſe to and fro continually. And I perceive that I could not reach any thing neer <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But it is a ſure Argument of ſmall reigning or power it hath in that ſoul, whoſe mouth and pen is ſo buſied to cavil, and write againſt it.</p>
                     <p>Alſo, may not another as truly ſay, That he ſets up the law, not who names it often, but whoſe heart is moſt ſenſibly and deeply affected with the power and inward work of it? ſome would be Doctors of the law, not knowing what they ſay, nor whereof they affirm 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.8.</p>
                     <p>And now alſo, who will moſt heartily and experimentally, ſet up and endear Chriſt, and free-grace? he who teacheth the law to be onely a rule of life, yet to have no reigning power, but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableth
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:53450:101"/>it from curſing and condemning, ſo that a man may bleſs himſelf, and finde peace and reſt in the righteouſneſs of his owne works? or he that teacheth that the law is ever revealing wrath, threatning, and purſuing with the dreadful curſe and vengeance all that are of the works of the law, in that when they have done their utmoſt. they are come ſhort of what it requireth: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it will ſuffer them to have no reſt nor confidence, ſave in the righteouſneſs of God by faith?</p>
                     <p>Certainly this mans doctrine will much more make Chriſt and Free-grace deſired and prized by all that have any diſcerning ſpirit, and a broken and believing heart.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter about fifteen years expectation, and the frequent threatnings of my many Adverſaries,<note place="margin">Mr. Rutherf. Mr. Burgeſs.</note> a reply unto and a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended confutation of my Anſwer to D. <hi>Tailors REGULA VITAE,</hi> is come forth; and that from men of ſuch eminency for learning, and gifts, that if theſe cannot effect what they intended and aymed at, others, not comparable for art, and qualifications, are not much to be feared. And yet to ſay the truth, (whatever contrary thoughts may be in others, through a different ſeeming light, or partiality of affection) I ſee nothing they write having any power and evidence to prevail, or to convince me as guilty of the leaſt Antinomy, or errour; but where they make any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of ſuch in me, it is there where they pervert, and pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably miſtake my words, and meaning.</p>
                  <p>There is a great interval, or ſpace of time between our comings into publick view, their printing and mine: but the reaſons are, <hi>1.</hi> It was long ere I knew, or heard of their books. <hi>2.</hi> I dwel in an obſcure and remote place, amongſt ſuch who little meddle with any thing controverſal. <hi>3.</hi> My bodily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, and little leiſure, do much retard me. <hi>4.</hi> And laſtly my owne thoughts will not eaſily, nor haſtily give way: but there have been divers months. ere I could obtain, and get free and full leave of them, to do any thing in this way
<pb facs="tcp:53450:106"/>of contention; although the bent of my minde, and weapons be onely defenſive, and in no wiſe to render my Adverſaries weaker or worſe, then they have manifeſted themſelves, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out one ſyllable of mine. Otherwiſe I finde it as eaſie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute, as it is to read their Objections.</p>
                  <p>In this my latter rejoydner, or reply, to M. <hi>Rutherf.</hi> Book, called, <hi>Chriſt Dying, and Drawing of ſinners,</hi> I have ſingled out, and ſpoken onely unto ſuch places or paſſages, as he except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt in my <hi>Aſſertion of Grace,</hi> not intermedling with any thing written againſt M. <hi>Salmarſh,</hi> M. <hi>Denne</hi> or others: becauſe, <hi>1.</hi> I have not their Books, and ſo cannot know how candidly be dealeth with them. <hi>2.</hi> That may be clear truth to them in their owne Notions, and conceptions, which I may miſapprehend or darken. <hi>3.</hi> They are better able to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and clear themſelves, if they ſee occaſion: and may have done ſo, for any thing I know.</p>
                  <p>If my Adverſarie think himſelf wronged, or diſcredited hereby; I anſwer, I ſhould be ſorry to ſtand guilty of doing that wrong to him, as he hath done againſt me, and the truth it ſelf. <hi>2.</hi> As for diſcredit, he knoweth, that the truth when it cometh forth will ſhame all that oppoſe, or contend againſt it: his chief wiſdome had been, not to have medled. Otherwiſe I have been cautelous in aſperſing him (only ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time returning his owne words, I aske, Who now is the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomian, Libertine? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) but have tendered his credit as my owne. Their owne doings have procured all unto them.</p>
                  <p>It had been much better (I am ſure more eaſily effected, and more love had been in it, and the peace of the Church had not been ſo diſturbed) if they had caſt the mantle of a favourable conſtruction upon what ſeeming errours, or failings appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in D. <hi>Criſp,</hi> and others: and given ſome cantion to the people, not to miſtake and abuſe ſuch words of Free-Grace, and precious conſolations.</p>
                  <p>And if they will ſtill proceed in this way, after ſuch convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and evidence, they may. The <hi>Philiſtine,</hi> having found their Dagon fallen before the Ark of God, yet would ſet it up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain (a baſe Competitor) till it loſt both hands, and head, and nothing but a filthy ſtump was left. Let them preſume of parts,
<pb facs="tcp:53450:106"/>place, and repute in the Church (as a Knight of the Parliament ſaid once to me, in the ſame caſe; <hi>It makes no matter what ſuch a mans doctrine, or opinion be, his worth and eſteem will win him the field</hi>) yet let them conſider withall, that the righteous God dwelleth with the humble; and ſeeth every one that is proud in heart, to abaſe him: And none, exalting himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him can proſper.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, as the Phariſaical, and Antichriſtian ſpirit will live and breath in ſome unto the end; ſo the more any are found to walk in the pure ſteps of Chriſts, <hi>Stephens,</hi> or <hi>Pauls</hi> Miniſtery or Doctrine, the more will that Spirit be diſpoſed and ready to cavil, and except againſt them as Antinomians, Libertines, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers, Hereticks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Oh how reproachful, odious, and bitter are their words! how do they defame and declaim againſt us, and breath out threatnings ſtill, if ever the ſword come into their hands! And alas, what have we done! what error or fault do they make to appear in us! Thou maiſt ſee, good Reader, what cauſe and colour they have.</p>
                  <p>Yet ſome Object, If we be not Antinomians, why do we not make it appear ſo? and why do we not ſpeak againſt them that are, as do others? My anſwer is; <hi>1.</hi> I hope now it is moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, we are not Antinomians: and that charge to be moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due, and unjuſt. <hi>2.</hi> I have preached over the whole Decalogue, and the Lords-Prayer; And yet, they ſay, I caſt out the law, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, and all duties out of the Church: how can their mouths be ſtopped? <hi>3.</hi> And in truth I know not one Antinomian: And to rail or to ſpeak ſo bitterly, and conſtantly againſt ſuch, and the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpreading of that ſect, as do many, is to confirm that falſe opinion in the hearers mindes: which I wiſh much rather might dye, and periſh.</p>
                  <p>I hear of Sects in our Land, and Kingdom, incredible for num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and nature. And I bleſs God, that I am acquainted with none, that adhere to any, as I know: for I have determined to know nothing among my people, but Chriſt, and him Crucified: And I both wiſh and ſtrive, that they, and I may live onely by the faith of him; for therein is all ſpiritual peace, reſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation: and thence freely and continually floweth humility, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, patience, confidence, ſelf-denial, obedience, love, goodneſs.
<pb facs="tcp:53450:107"/>Many endeavour in vain to hammer, and beat out an unwilling ſervice, and ungrateful performances by a legal Miniſtery: and do ſometime change and reform the outward life; but the heart is ſtill the ſame, unmortified, not purified, nor pacified: God doth draw his with cords of love unto him. And the word of the Kingdome (which is the Goſpel of ſalvation) is like leaven hid in the Meal, which effectually altereth, and turneth all into its owne nature. Thus, the wiſdome from above is pure, then peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, gentle, eaſie to be entreated, full of mercy, and good fruits: without partiality, whithout hypocriſie, <hi>Jam. 3.17.</hi> hence alſo, They ſhall not hurt, nor deſtroy in all my holy mountain, ſaith the Lord, <hi>Iſa. 11.9.</hi> But, alas for we, the fruit of doctrine, now a dayes is, <hi>That the Wolf ſhall not dwell with the Lamb,</hi> &amp;c. It is time for the Lord to put to his hand.</p>
                  <p>Reader, Thou art now to judge, and determine whoſe be the errours and miſtakes. Be thou wiſe, and impartial, and if any can in love clear them to be mine, he may call for my retractation, and have it. The Lord keep us in that faith and love, which is in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>

The kingdom of grace and glory is but one in nature and kind, as all do aſſert: the difference is in regard of degrees. And the entrance into it, is by regeneration, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5. which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all works; therefore we do rightly teach, that a man muſt firſt be in the <hi>New-Jeruſalem</hi> the City of God, before he can walk in it. 5. If you will take the kingdom ſtrictly for the future ſtate of glory and felicity, (which you know your <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomians</hi> do not in this their poſition) yet even then it is the free gift of God without condition of our works, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53450:108"/>
                     <hi>The free gift of God is eternal life through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi>

Laſtly, There is one in your boſome will tell you, that we are not againſt good works, which God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained that we ſhould walk in amongſt men; onely as you grant them to be improperly conditions of life, ſo we according to the Scriptures and the Orthodox, do affirm that opinion to be falſe and dangerous, from which it's moſt hard to withdraw mens minds and thoughts, it is ſo naturall unto them; and in the beſt conſtruction, it doth obſcure <hi>the free grace of God in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Importing, that Chriſt ſaveth not without works: or faith cannot receive Chriſt in the promiſe for both righteouſneſs and life: but he is held forth for ſalvation upon condition and after our good works: ſo that faith alſo muſt be kept in ſuſpence and Gods promiſe too, untill the end of our holy walking.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Rutherf. Neither do theſe places make juſtification and regeneration all one, as Mr.</hi> T. <hi>with other</hi> Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <hi>do: for we are not regenerated by faith, but that we may believe: but we are juſtified by faith.</hi> 2. <hi>Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on putteth in us a new birth, the image of the ſecond</hi> Adam: <hi>juſtification formally is for the imputed righteouſneſs of Chriſt, which is in Chriſt, not in us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply.</hi> 1. You may ſee there (pag. 78.) that it is brought in as the ſaying of <hi>Melancthon,</hi> whoſe words upon <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. are theſe, <hi>Chriſtus juſtificationem dicit eſſe regenerationem,</hi> &amp;c. Chriſt ſaith that juſtification is regeneration: this is indeed to mortifie the fleſh, and to be renewed in Spirit. True morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is the ſence or feeling of death, whereby the fleſh is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded and judged: vivification is, in that death, a ſenſe of life, peace, joy of heart, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>As alſo of Mr. <hi>Fox,</hi> who ſaith thus: <q>Regeneration is not a being altered into a new bodily ſubſtance from what we were, but a being turned by reconciliation into a new ſtate of grace: ſo as ſuch, who were before dead to God, and damnable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and children of wrath, are now accepted, purged, juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied from the malediction of original and actual ſin: they who were ſeparated from God, are reſtored again into favour and grace.</q> I could adde others of as good judgement and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53450:108"/>experience, as is any adverſary.</p>
                  <p>Your reaſons are invalid: for 1. If regeneration be to faith, and ſo be before it, then it followeth, that either we come not to Chriſt, and become one with him by faith: (which elſewhere you affirme, as do others) or elſe regeneration doth precede our uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which is againſt the noon-light of Scriptures. We are in Chriſt before we become new creatures, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.1, 2.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Then regeneration is not the begetting of man again to God, as <hi>Jam</hi> 1.18. but a begetting of new qualities, or a renewing of Gods Image in him, who as yet is a ſinner in the ſtate of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a Child of wrath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſo the accident will be before and without its proper ſubject: there being found the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Sonne, without the Sonſhip it-ſelf. Or at leaſt by your opinion one may be regenerated, and ſo the Child of God, who is not as yet juſtified nor in favour and acceptance with God. This is clear, if regeneration be to faith. And then we are to believe, that we may be juſtified, reconciled, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Then alſo, either the word is not the ſeed of our new birth, as 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23. or elſe the word is effectual to regenation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out and before faith. But the word profiteth not without faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.2. And faith is firſt required to make us Sonnes of God, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. The power to become the Sonnes of God is given to them that receive Chriſt, or believe in him: ſo <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.26. <hi>Ye are all the Children of God by faith in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> If by faith, then not before it.</p>
                  <p>Our ſecond thoughts may be more ſatisfactory.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Rutherf.</hi> pag. 257. <hi>Mortification and new obedience, as Mr.</hi> T. <hi>and others ſay, is but faith in Chriſt: and not abſtinence from wordly luſts, that war againſt the ſoul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply.</hi> 1. Abſtinence from worldly luſts, cannot be mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation formally and properly ſo called, for it is to kill and cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie luſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.24. that is more then to abſtain from it. 2. Your accuſation is falſe; for I ſay not ſo: ſee the place again.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Rutherf.</hi> pag. 272: <hi>To repent, to mortifie ſin, is not to condemn all our works,</hi> (<hi>as Mr.</hi> T. <hi>ſaith,</hi> Aſſert. pag. 15, 16.) <hi>righteouſneſs, and judgement, and our beſt things in us, and then by faith to flee to grace: nor is it to diſtruſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53450:109"/>our own righteouſneſs, and to embrace Chriſt in the promiſe. Becauſe</hi> 1. <hi>this is faith, and we are juſtified by faith, not by repentance and mortification: neither receive we Chriſt by repentance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply.</hi> Your wrong is manifold: for I confound not faith and repentance: but ſay, that they are inſeparable in the ſubject, and yet to be diſtinguiſhed, as <hi>Mark</hi> 1.15. <hi>Repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Goſpel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. I do not make repentance and to mortifie ſin all one, as I there ſpeak of repentance.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Neither ſay I, that to repent and to mortifie ſinne, is by faith to flye to grace, embrace Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Law is againſt you as a falſe witneſs in all theſe. And you cannot but perceive that I ſpeak of that legal repentance and mortification, which you with others ſo much ſtand for, as requiſite before faith. Which is when a man is ſo laid open to himſelf, ſo effectually convinced, and wrought upon by the Law, that he ſeeth, acknowledgeth, and renounceth all things in him and done by him, as ſinne and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination before the Lord, whatever eſteem he hath had of them formerly, or whatever ſhew they may make. Yea, and as ſinne, <hi>the ſting of death,</hi> appears and reviveth in all, which is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mortification, the wounding and killing of the ſoul, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.10. ſo all theſe ſeeming excellencies and good things become mortified within him, and his heart that lived and rejoyced in them, now dyeth unto them: finding nothing but vanity, ſin, and death in all things out of Chriſt. Thus he repenteth and changeth his mind with ſhame and ſorrow, that ever he ſo exalted and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed his own righteouſneſs of works, as did <hi>Paul</hi> and thoſe zealous <hi>Jews</hi> being converted to the faith.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe we are neceſſitated to carry this body of death to the grave, and therefore ſin and death will ever and unavoidably be in us and all our works; and we can by faith in Chriſt alone, finde true righteouſneſs, life, peace, confidence, joy and ſalvation: hence Chriſt is our onely treaſure who hath our hearts delight, and all elſe are renounced, and accounted as dung and droſs, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. You neither may nor can rightly underſtand my words as ſpoken of that Evangelical repentance, or mortifying of ſin in life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation by the Spirit, of which we read, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.5.</p>

You have a ſatisfactory anſwer in my former Reply. I may challenge you to produce one ſyllable for a Law commanding, without its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning power. Remember <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.17, 18.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the Law requires obedience out of love, its true; but we worke from ſelf-love, and for ſelf-ends, <hi>viz.</hi> that we may <hi>live thereby, and not dye.</hi> The firſt <hi>Adam</hi> by his obedience might have preſerved himſelf, in that life and ſtate of holineſs and happineſs he had by creation: but now in Chriſt our life and and felicity is attained and kept by faith: we believe that we may live. And we love and obey freely, for no ſuch ends, as not ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and falling by our obedience or diſobedience moral. Alſo if our love be changed from legal into evangelical, void of ſelfneſs, Yet that altereth not the cords of the law, nor the chaines we were in; but Chriſt hath happily freed us from them. The change is in the true Chriſtian, and in his eſtate, but you can ſhew no change in the Law. Neither do we deſtroy the Law, as you ſlander us

                  <p>This alſo will ſerve for that exception in pag. 275. where you ſet the ſame Coleworts before your Reader.

                     <hi>Reply.</hi> Juſtification puts the ſoul into a preſent ſtate of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Scriptures are plain. <hi>He hath ſaved us,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.9. Tit. 3.5. Eph. 2.8. and <hi>Theſe things have I written unto you that believe, &amp;c. that ye may know that ye have eternal life,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.13. <hi>This is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son</hi> ver. 11. and Epheſ. 2.5. <hi>God hath quickned us together with Chriſt, and hath rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed us up together, and made us ſit together in heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> I muſe you ſtumble in ſo clear light. Hence, ſaith <hi>Muſculus, Before God</hi> we are all that which he willed, and alſo hath cauſed us to be. Chriſt is not alone in his eyes, but we alſo are conjoyned to him. The Aſſertion doth preſent you with teſtimonyes ſufficient. you believe ſo farre as you ſee and feel. If you deny our perfection in Chriſt our head (<hi>In
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53450:110"/>whom we are compleat</hi> Col. 2.10) deny alſo our union with him, that we have received him, have him, <hi>are now the Sons of God,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.2. Yea, then deny that God hath given us as yet Chriſt, and life in and with him: but all is ſtill kept in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, and reſerved till future. So where the Spirit of truth ſaith, God hath given unto us Chriſt and eternal life in him, your Ghoſt ſaith, nay, but he will, his promiſe is <hi>de futuro:</hi> give us them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition of our good works, and by them as a way we muſt come to Chriſt and ſalvation. God hath conveyed and given nothing by promiſe. There is no Chriſt nor life in reality and ſubſtance communicated by the word and Sacrament: theſe are empty ſhels. The juſt liveth by faith, what feedeth he on to nouriſh and encreaſe life? what on the Wind? well, you teach that we muſt live in hope to have all in the end, upon condition of our obedience and ſervice. And for this reaſon you call upon men to work and pleaſe God. But the truth ſaith, Chriſt hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved all for us: and we enjoy all in him.</p>
                  <p>You ſay, that becauſe we hold works are no conditions of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, therefore we looſe mens reines to carnal walking.

Its Gods act to ſanctifie throughout, you cannot make one hair white or black: Who would think that Mr. <hi>Rutherf.</hi> would quarrel with this? You alter my words, to make them capable of your gloſs and ſenſe. But all men may ſee that I ſpeak of the act of ſanctification, and not of the expreſſion and fruits of it.

                     <note place="margin">Pag. 501.</note> David <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed his ſins, not according to truth and the confeſſion of faith, but from want and weakneſs of faith,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply.</hi> My words are <hi>David</hi> prayed that his ſins might be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned; which you grant were pardoned. Now then did he thus pray according to truth and the confeſſion of faith; or from want or weakneſs of faith, and of the effectual apprehenſion of forgiveneſs? Is not Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> now the <hi>Antinomian,</hi> who againſt Law ſo palpably miſtakes his Adverſary? There is great difference between confeſſing of ſinne, and praying for pardon. If God, my own conſcience, men, yea Satan require that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs my ſelf a ſinner, I ſhall readily do it: for this is to juſtifie God in his Law, ſaying, There is none righteous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this may well ſtand with my faith, and effectual apprehenſion of pardon: for I confeſs what I am in my ſelf: I believe what I am in Chriſt, through that grace that juſtifieth the ungodly. Thus while your miſtakes onely make me erroneous (whom otherwiſe you find not ſo) who is now the <hi>Antinomian?</hi> Is not the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the errour? ſo all will returne to your own diſcredit and diſadvantage: And what a groſs ſlander is that which followeth, <hi>viz. Town and all Antinomians</hi> teach, that it is unbeliefe, a worke of the fleſh, of old <hi>Adam,</hi> &amp;c. that juſtified perſons confeſs or feel ſin, ſorrow, or complain of the body of ſin, as <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7? This is as if the continual dwelling of ſinne in us, did not trouble us, or could not conſiſt with faith in juſtification by Chriſt: or that now the ſpiritual eſtate of the ſoul, being clear and ſafe, made up in Chriſt, ſin in no other regard were ſorrow or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to us. But you cannot in this neither make good your charge: You care little how falſly you accuſe us, ſo that you make your Bill foul and black enough to make us ſtill more odious and vile.</p>

You ſay I pervert <hi>Luther;</hi> take his words again. So mightily, ſaith he, worketh faith, that he that believeth that Chriſt hath taken away ſin from him, he like Chriſt is void of ſin. Again Chriſt will have us to believe, that like as in his own perſon there is now no ſin, nor death, even ſo there is none in ours; there is no defect in the thing it ſelf, but in our incredulity. Let us ſee what conſtruction, or ſenſe you can make of theſe words. But you pervert my words, or meaning, as if I meant it, that ſin dwelleth not ſtill in us: a fiction. But <hi>Luther</hi> addeth, as you read in the Aſſertion, That to reaſon its a hard matter to believe theſe ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable good things, and unſpeakable riches.

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Rutherf.

And ſuch ſtrict conformity to the law, we hold to be true ſanctification, though all enemies to holy walking cry out againſt it, ſuch as are all mockers of all reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the Prelatical and Antinomian party, who mock ſtrait walking.</hi>

I know Proteſtant Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines hold ſanctification to iſſue out of juſtifying faith; and you cannot but know many who deny it, and that ſome will have ſanctification to be coetaneous unto, yea to precede juſtification. 2. If it be the iſſue and fruit of faith, by which the heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth firſt to juſtification and ſalvation; how is it that you teach ſtrict conformity to be a neceſſary condition, mean or way of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which by faith is attained in order before holy walking? <hi>He that believeth is ſaved.

But what is the power of ſubduing ſin to the Antinomians? not ſanctification, but juſtification; that is, a power to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Chriſt hath obeyed law for me — we are obliged to no perſonal ſanctification,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>then to be inherently holy is unlawful to Antinomians.</hi>

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53450:114"/>being diſpoſed to take occaſion to wrangle, you demand what it is to ſubdue ſin? whereas it is ſet before you: even the weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the power of ſin within us, that it domineer not over us. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Prophet, <hi>Micah</hi> 7.19. uſeth the phraſe of ſubduing by juſtification, and that is a true ſubduing it in the conſcience, that it there raign not to death &amp; condemnation. And yet by your confeſſion, this muſt precede, and is the proper cauſe of ſubduing it in converſation: and then that will neceſſarily follow, iſſuing out of this faith: So that in fine, this is but a Papiſtical cavil, That to teach juſtification is the overthrow of holineſs and good works. Laſtly, whereas you tell of obliging to ſanctification, I anſwer, we are to believe, that God will ſanctifie us, and that throughout, and put his Spirit into us, to lead us in his wayes; and ſo in that faith deſiring and hungering after it, to ſeek to him (as a ſick man longing for health, unto his Phyſitian) and to wait in the uſe of his ordinances, that he may ſo perform. The new Covenant proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly requireth nothing of man; but God, knowing his ſpiritual po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, and utter diſability, calleth upon him to ſeek to him, who worketh both the will and the deed of his owne pleaſure. <hi>Open thy mouth, and I will fill it,</hi> Pſal. 81.

To be juſtified and to be in Chriſt, is not all one, as your gloſs is; they differ as the cauſe and the effect, or as the antecedent and conſequent.

The ſtrength of ſinne is the Law,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.56. 2 <hi>Chriſt dyed that the righteouſneſs of the Law might be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in us,</hi> imputatively: or grant, inherently: yet if this be the end and fruit of Chriſts death, as you ſay, then the Law is no active cauſe of it, but the power of Chriſts death effecteth it. And though this righteouſneſs be for matter one with the Law, yet ſtill the Law is but a rule paſſively, according to which the believer is conformed and regulated, it not actively regulating. Alſo active
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53450:117"/>walking in the Law, is but the expreſſion and effect of ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not properly ſanctification it ſelf. <hi>Adam</hi> made holy, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved accordingly from that inward form: his holy life made him not holy. Neither is our holy life to procure or preſerve peace, favour, life, as the Law propoundeth &amp; requireth it: for theſe conſiſt in faith alone: which findeth and enjoyeth Chriſt to be ſuch a true fulneſs and <hi>All-ſufficiency</hi> to the ſoul, that <hi>ſelf</hi> by him and with him is ſatisfied, and ſo needs no ends of its own in working and obeying, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.35. <hi>He that cometh to me ſhall never hunger, and he that believeth on me ſhall never thirſt.</hi>

                  <p>Mr. Rutherf. <hi>We are freed from the Law being once juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> (ſo the Antinomians) <hi>whatever we do is not againſt a Law or rule, — the law gives a diſpenſation to do thoſe things being juſtified, which the unjuſtified cannot do, but in doing it they ſinne: becauſe the unjuſtified are under the law as a rule of juſtice, which we are not under. We have an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidated diſpenſation to ſinne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply.</hi> You ſtraine your wit, if not conſcience, to make <hi>quid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libet ex quolibet:</hi> But I ſay, Take juſtification in the full lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and extent of it; or conſider a Chriſtian ſtill as juſtified, and ſo he is freed from under the Law: but if you ſpeak of, or conſider him in his active righteouſneſs of works, ſo as you bring him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, ſo he ſinneth; yea and is judged and condemned by the Law; and you muſt raiſe him and bring him up to his juſtified ſtate, ere he can be free and ſecure from the curſe. Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication extends to all ſins at all times throughout the whole life. But its falſe, that I give an Antidated dipenſation; that is your indirect inference. If you put the believer under the Law, as he ſinneth, like the unjuſtified, ſo the Law threatneth and curſeth both equally. Though you tell us unwarrantably (of your bare word) that the Law hath power to rule, where it hath no power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn: then we may live ſecurely in ſin or the works of the law: and need no more make uſe of juſtification, nor have Chriſt for our ſhadow and protection.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Rutherf. p. 591. <hi>That the Saints are meer patients and blocks in all their holy walking is groſs libertiniſme.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply.</hi> But how unjuſtly do you charge this upon your Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary! who ſaith onely in the act of ſanctification: in which the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53450:118"/>Spirit onely acteth. Is not this to pervert what is ſpoken?</p>
                  <p>M. Rutherf. <hi>No way cryeth to the conſcience of the travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, This is the way, as the law doth in its directing and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling power,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply.</hi> The law materially is reſembled to the high-way: and its true, the high-way calleth not to the paſſenger to keep his way; yet the authority of the King doth ſo call and require: ſo then it is not the law as we conſider it, and ſpeak of it; but God the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the law, who commandeth to walk in it. And if God in ſo doing, convince you of unrighteouſneſs for your going aſtray, Is not his grace in the Goſpel your dayly needful refuge, and plea? or you ſtill are in no danger, nor fear, becauſe law cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn? for God ſay you is pleaſed with what the poor man can do, or give. Thus you live under a law ſecurely, which is as weak as your ſelf: and will be content with with any thing, as you liſt, or can obey. Whereas, I on the other ſide, ſay, that the law hath loſt no power nor part of its perfection, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.17, 18. And therefore it convinceth all of ſin, and condemneth ſuch as are found under it, becauſe in many things we ſin all. In our beſt works we are found faulty and judged, that we may finde no reſt, nor ſafety, but in the righteouſneſs of Chriſt by faith. Let the Reader judge, who is in the errour.</p>
                  <p>But it is no marvel you ſo miſ-call, miſtake, &amp; pervert your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, and falſly accuſe him (as you do <hi>paſſion</hi>) and yet have no check of conſcience for it, ſeeing you are ſo principled that you may tranſgreſs, and do any thing, <hi>impure</hi> that is, Scot-free, by your law, and are not led by a right-Goſpel-Spirit.</p>

                  <p>Mr. Rutherf. pag. 593. <hi>Still Antinomians bewray their engine. If me ſay (being juſtified) we have no ſin, we lye,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.10. <hi>then there cannot be a man nyon the earth, but he is under the curſe of God — Antinomians ſay, the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied are freed from the curſe; then they have no ſinne; nay, they cannot ſinne, by their Argument; for they will have the curſe eſſentially and inſeparably to follow ſinne; which is moſt falſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply.</hi> 1. If we be juſtified from the curſe, then from the ſin
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53450:118"/>which yet we have remaining in us, <hi>(Coram judieio Dei)</hi> for the cauſe is taken away before the effect.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Elſe by the contrary, Chriſt is not our righteouſneſs in juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, (which is oppoſed to ſin) but onely our bleſſedneſs, in ſtead of the curſe that was upon us: how then is it ſaid, he brought in everlaſting righteouſneſs? <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24. And that we are made the righteouſneſs of God in him? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. So there is no man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but he is under the curſe, if the blood of Chriſt have not waſhed him from his ſinne, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5. <hi>He hath loved us, and waſhed us from our ſinne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. In order juſtification is after ſinne, and it being extenſive to all ſinnes paſt, preſent, and to come, it muſt preſuppoſe future ſinnes alſo as done, before it aboliſh either ſinne, or curſe due for ſinne.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. You ſay, Its moſt falſe that ſinne and the curſe be inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; but you neither prove nor can ſhew any thing to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Indeed a carnally ſecure heart, is apt to ſeparate them, and is thereby hardened, preſuming to ſinne without danger or fear, <hi>Deut,</hi> 29.19. If you allow of his engine, as better ſuiting with your own, you may well miſlike ours.</p>
                  <p n="5">5.

Your <hi>Simile</hi> giveth me moſt light, <hi>viz.</hi> That as the riſing of the Sun, is the way to the full noon-day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I anſwer, but ſo it is no act of ours, but of the Spirit ſanctifying us throughout, till we be perfected in our ſelves; and ſo it is not ſimply our repentance and new-obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which are conſequences effects and expreſſions of that reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation or ſanctification. And I demand alſo, Is not that blot it ſelf ſo taken away, <hi>ut non imputetur,</hi> as not reckoned to us, by the death of Chriſt? though it abide phyſically, or inherently, yet in our accounts it is aboliſhed, and blotted out.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, I muſt that you will except againſt that expreſſion in <hi>Aſſert.</hi> pag. 15. <hi>The Law of workes</hi> is ſo inwrapt and entwi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together, that if a man lay hold on any, even the leaſt link, he inevitably pulleth the whole chaine upon himſelf; And yet what you ſay is of no force. Your repentance and love of bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53450:119"/>if you underſtand your ſelf, do pull the whole Law upon you, as they be your acts. You cannot oblige your ſelf in part and in ſome degrees onely as you pleaſe. Wo to that life moſt commendably paſſed over, if the grace of the Goſpel be not to pardon all imperfections. <hi>All our righteouſneſſes are as filthy ragges,</hi> Iſa, 64.6. <hi>Therefore durſt not</hi> Paul <hi>be found in his own righteouſneſs,</hi> Phil. 3.9.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Rutherf. pag. 595. <hi>Our obedience is not full and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect onely it's ſo counted and accepted in Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply.</hi> If this were all your meaning, that our obedience or works as proceeding from us, or as we perform them, are imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. yet are accepted as perfect in Chriſt; I could receive it. But you explain your ſelf otherwiſe. 1. You ſay, It is not ſo, and yet it is accounted perfec; doth not God account it rightly as it is? 2. You are againſt all ſound Proteſtant Divines, if you hold of acceptance with God of any work becauſe of any proper, formal, inherent dignity in it; or if you do not make Chriſt the alone ground, reaſon, and cauſe of all acceptance whether of perſons or performances. 3. It is true God accounts not us non-ſinners in our ſelves, and free from all indwelling ſinne; for that were an untruth; but he both juſtifieth us by faith in Chriſt, and makes us pure and free from all ſpot of ſinne, before his Judgement ſeat, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.22. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7. <hi>The blood of Jeſus cleanſeth us from all ſinne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now you are pleaſed to expatiate, and to amplifie your ſelf needleſly and wilfully, to wreſt our words; as if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> we did not hold the good works of the regenerate to be faulty in themſelves. 2 As if we meant by the removal (as you call it) or abolition of finne, ſuch an annihilation of ſinne in its eſſence root and branch, that it ſhould not dwell in us here; whereas you know and read the contrary.</p>
                  <p>Yet, that both Tree and the Fruit, the believer and his work, are acceptable in Chriſt, is no new divinity; but according to Scripture and all the Orthodox, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. <hi>To the pure all things are pure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Your Scriptures 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.2. do ſpeak of works as proceeding from us, not as preſented in Chriſt, who juſtifieth, and freeth us from all the evil and filth cleaving to them.</p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:53450:119"/>
                  <p>I retort, If God can accept of us, or our performances out of Chriſt, what need we then continually to deal with God in Chriſt? 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.15. <hi>By him let us offer the ſacrifice of praiſe to God continually: Whatſoever you do in word or deed, Do all things in the name of our Lord Jeſus, giving thankes to God, even the Father by him.</hi> Coloſ. 3.17.</p>
                  <p>But this is open wrong which you do us in ſaying, that we hold works perfect ſimply in themſelves, or to be accepted for any worth or inherent dignity in them; which is your doctrine ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: we teach, That <hi>Abels</hi> ſacrifice was accepted by faith, that is by Chriſt believed on; and not for any merit in it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.4. The Scriptures and Teſtimonies of the Orthodox (which you read in the <hi>Aſſertion</hi>) might have prevented all this labour, if you had been ſo adviſed.</p>

                     </note> &amp;c. Thoſe good works which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after juſtification, are eſteemed and valued otherwiſe, then by their own deſert or dignity: for whatever imperfection is in them, it is covered with Chriſts perfection: whatever blemiſh or filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in them it is cleanſed by his purity, leſt it ſhould be queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned or examined before Gods judgement ſeat. Therefore ſaith he the fault of all our tranſgreſſions being blotted out, whereby men are hindered from bringing forth any thing acceptable to God; and the imperfection and defect, which is wont to defile all good works, being buried, all the good works of the faithfull are acknowledged to be juſt. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus may all ſee how palpably you have miſtaken me in this, as in the other paſſages; And how indirectly and falſly you do inferre, That we may be juſtified by works, or we make them meritorious, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereas we ſay plainly, that the perſon is firſt juſtified, without and before all works: and that then they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come accepted and pleaſing by the ſame way and reaſon; that the perſon came into favour: For as God ſtands and appears propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to us in Chriſt, and ſo his works and dealings with us, and diſpoſals of us be pleaſing and welcome to us; even ſo we being received and accepted in Chriſt, what we do through him is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to God: but not becauſe of any formal and intrinſecal dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in the work. So that we ſtudy to deal with God onely in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53450:120"/>Chriſt, and are now incouraged unto all good works: for who can have a heart to do any good work, till he by faith know, that he pleaſeth God by Jeſus Chriſt? So Chriſt alone is exalted and magnified.</p>

                     <hi>To ſeek Heaven by works and deſervings, is to wrong, yea to ſhame Chriſts blood: and unto ſuch it is ſhed in vain. When the Goſpel is preached unto us, we believe the mercy of God, and in believing receive the Spirit, the earneſt of eternal life, and be in eternal life already: and feel in our hearts already the ſweetneſs thereof, and are overcome with the kindneſs of God and of Chriſt: and therefore love the will of God, and of love are ready to worke freely; and not to obtain that which is given already, and whereof we be heirs by Grace freely.</hi> Tindall Martyr.</p>

                        <hi>Reply.</hi> 1. To aſſert a mixt juſtice, is to temper and mingle Law and Goſpel without warrant: and to hold forth God in a Covenant made up both of <hi>free-grace</hi> and works, which yet be inconſiſtent, — <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.6. 2. Our Divines diſtinguiſh indeed between puniſhment and chaſtiſement: and ſo call theſe correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Children, and not puniſhment properly: for that every pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment is in ſome ſort ſatisfactory. And ſo will that be inferred, which by them is objected againſt the Papiſts, <hi>viz.</hi> If the Saints
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53450:121"/>be puniſhed for their ſinnes temporally, then Chriſt ſatisfied for pounds, and left us to ſatisfie for pence. 3. The true and intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecal nature and property of all juſtice offended requireth ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction: ſo that our puniſhments muſt be ſatisfactory alſo, ſo far as the ſinne deſerveth: elſe who, or what ſatisfieth? doth this mixt juſtice take its pennyworth and full due out of the fleſh and bones of Gods Children, ſo as God neither can ceaſe beating till he hath given all the ſtripes the fault deſerveth: and when cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection is paſt, then the Fathers juſtice is quieted? 4. And if you put them under the Government of juſtice tempered with mildneſs and mercy, (which is Law Evangelized: a new crotchet and dream) then the Law of ſtrict juſtice, which is the decalogue, is no longer a rule: our ſinnes muſt be no longer examined and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by it, but judged as they are offences of this mixt and fatherly juſtice. So now Chriſt may be ſet aſide, we ſhall no more need him for Advocate, neither is there uſe of faith when we ſinne: but our ſufferings muſt in this condition pacifie, not Chriſts paſſion, (that onely was of uſe and efficacy to bring us into this ſtate, and under this Government.) Who now are become the total abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the Moral and pure Law, yea and as it is a rule to live and walk by? Can you tell us how much of juſtice, and what a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of mercy is in this new rule and Government? But the reſult is, That our ſins after juſtification have a double relation: (and had but one before) one to the ſtrict Law, and that Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented: the other is to a milder juſtice, againſt which our <hi>ſtripes</hi> muſt be oppoſed, that by them we may be healed.</p>
                     <p>Its granted, during the Moſaical-pedagogie, there was ſome ſhew, yea ground for ſomewhat, but not for all that here you aſſert: for God did in that diſpenſation veil his Paternity, which now in Chriſt is done away.

                     <p n="2">2 Againſt what is ſaid to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. Mr. Rutherf. ſaith, <hi>Faith doth no more hinder a juſtified perſon to receive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily the Lords Supper, then it doth hinder him to commit Adultery.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reply.</hi> It's true, faith is not alway effectual in all to hinder the doing of both theſe. But what then? Is it not for want of the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53450:121"/>exerciſe of faith in vigour, life, and perfection, that theſe or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſins are not prevented? So if faith do not hinder, what then can hinder? what purifieth the heart, and rightly principleth and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth the ſoul to all good actions, but faith? but not faith as a dead quality, or habit lying ſtill and idle within: but as it's lively and operative, according to its nature and property. 2. What elſe doth the Soul in eating and drinking the Lords Supper imploy, or ſet on work, but faith? Nay, is the act of eating and drinking formally, any other thing but to believe? So that if faith be not to be put forth and exerciſed, (and then where is juſtification?) there may be a bodily action in uſing the viſible Elements, which is unworthy indeed, and not befitting a Chriſtian, but no ſpiritual eating, as the Ordinance requireth. You make your ſelf ſport, ſaying, Mr. <hi>T's. ſenſe ſeemeth to carry, That a juſtified perſon cannot ſinne, nor eat and drink unworthily, becauſe faith makes him worthy: and if ſo the way is a wanton merry way. Reply.</hi> My words ſpeak no ſuch thing, if you lift to ſpell them aright: but if your ill-will ſuffer you not, The Lord forgive, and amend it. Faith includeth all. It preſuppoſeth hunger and thirſt before eating, 2. a true and ſpiritual receiving, 3. inward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing and ſatisfaction thereby, whence 4. followeth love, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing; with thankſgiving: ſo that he who eateth and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in faith, cannot eat and drink unworthily.</p>
                     <p>The ground out of which all your ſeven Arguments grow and receive their ſuppoſed ſtrength, is, that mixt-juſtice, or that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical-Government, which we do not now live under. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that failing, they will all totter and fall. It needs then your ſecond hand and labour to uphold and confirm it.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, to the ſeventh and laſt, requiring ſome more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular anſwer, I ſay, 1. <hi>That all afflictions are ſubſervient to the Law, and ſignes of wrath,</hi> is no errour or poſition of ours: neither is our aſſertion founded upon it. 2. Yet as afflictions come from juſtice offended and provoked, to inflict them for ſinne, ſo they are appendices of the Law: and you cannot diſprove it. 3. You adde, (as a thing that we hold) <hi>That as believers are freed from the ruling power of the Law, ſo are they alſo from the Rod.</hi> Whereas 1. your doctrine by a direct and neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence doth free the believer from the ruling power of the Law,

You may ſin, and we are made to ſuffer: but unleſs you bring in Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, this Covenant of Grace will prove abſolute, no part of it lying on us: for that preſuppoſeth ſome power and goodneſs where is none: for this Covenant is with man being fallen, and ſo having loſt all: therefore it behoveth that it ſhould be ſutable to his broken ſtate, requiring, neither promiſing no good conditionally, where nothing could be firſt given by him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is granted by all, that all was tranſacted between God the Father and the Sonne from eternity, and that the Covenant as it cometh and is commended to us, is as the breaking up of that great ſeal, the opening and manifeſtation of thoſe ſecrets concluded upon; ſo farre as they concern the raiſing of the Elect of God, out of their ſinful duſt, unto everlaſting bleſſedneſs: ſo that what is in the decree of heaven concerning them the ſame is contained in the Covenant: then as God purpoſed to give repentance, faith, holineſs, ſo he hath included and promiſed all in the Covenant: and theſe are truely parts and branches of it, and not properly conditions. Now we ſee, that as there were thoughts of peace in God for us, when we were in our loweſt and worſt condition; and in what way, and after what manner his mind is to recover our ſouls from their loſt Eſtates, and reſtore and give life, favour and glory unto them: ſo by this Covenant alſo, he hath laid &amp; cleared to us a firm ground, upon which we may with comfort and conſidence expect and wait
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53450:122"/>for faith, and all things to be given freely unto us. This agreeth to the expreſſions of <hi>Zanchie, Calvin, Parous,</hi> &amp;c. Indeed God ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth his due and ſet order, in giving and working one thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and another after: (ſo as a <hi>prius</hi> and a <hi>poſterius</hi> is granted) but the firſt, ſuppoſe repentance or faith, is not a condition of what followeth, except with us, and according to theſe Authors, you will call it a condition of <hi>ſtate:</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Conditio ſtatu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

As a Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſoweth not his land, till it be plowed and fitted: if he be asked why he doth not commit his ſeed to it, he will anſwer, it muſt be prepared firſt: but one part of his worke is not the condition of the other, when the whole lyeth on him. Again, if the promiſe to give faith and repentance be not in the Covenant, where is it to be found? Is there any thing to be looked for, not mentioned in the Covenant?</p>
                     <p n="3">3.

                     <p>Mr. Rutherf. <hi>They object, that God promiſeth all, as to give faith, to put Law in the inward parts, to cauſe to walk in his waies, as</hi> Jer. 31. Ezek. 36.26, 27. <hi>To circumciſe our hearts,</hi> Deut. 30.6. <hi>which the Arminians deny, yet is the

                     <p>
                        <hi>Reply.</hi> But you return not one ſyllable of a direct and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory anſwer unto it: you cannot deny, but what God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth, he is faithful to perform and do it. You inferre ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct and undue conſequences, as if you would rather wrangle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the truth, which you cannot reſiſt, or were offended that it ſhineth forth ſo gloriouſly and convincingly in your face. What if Dogs abuſe it, and Phariſaical Spirits (otherwiſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled) ſpurne againſt it, or miſ-conſtrue it, as occaſioning Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiniſme? the ſin be theirs; yet this is the onely right ground and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of prayer, and uſing all Gods Ordinances, in which the ſoul carrying it ſelf paſſively, waiteth, that God may communicate and pour out his bleſſings according to his word. Becauſe God had promiſed firſt, and that freely, the building of <hi>Davids</hi> houſe, and the King ſaw thereby, that God had a gracious mind and purpoſe to do it, and that it ſhould be his act, therefore <hi>David</hi> prayed that the Lord would bleſs his houſe, that it might continue for ever before God, <hi>For thou O Lord haſt ſpoken it.</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.27, 28, 29. If all fulneſs be in the fountain, and free acceſs may be had, it ſtanding open to all; It is an effectual invitation to come.</p>
                     <p>As for thoſe opinions bred and breathed in <hi>New-England,</hi> I know nothing of them; neither am I ſo credulous, or uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble towards any, as to receive whatever an Adverſary reporteth: for if the liquor be never ſo pretious and pure, yet if it come out of a fuſty and tainted veſſel, it will taſte of the Caske. I ſee none of you ſo candid, but in ſome things you wrong the Author in perverting his words or meaning, even when it is printed, and obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to every eye.</p>
                     <p>But here you let all ſee that you cannot outwrangle the truth: for at laſt you chide your ſelf to agree, and yeeld to it: for 1 you ſay, I grant God worketh the condition. Then how is it mans condition? or how can it be ſaid to lye on him? 2 Truth is, ſay you, It's an unproper condition, for the whole bargain is pure Grace. Thus you are brought to grant all, and no thanke to you, for you would fain have it a condition ſtill. An <hi>unproper</hi> one muſt ſerve rather then none. God indeed worketh orderly one thing after another: the former, as is ſaid, we may call a State-condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53450:123"/>but not otherwiſe properly and without danger.</p>
                     <p>But ere you ceaſe, you tell us again of Libertiniſme, <hi>&amp;c. Reply.</hi> Well, receive the love of the truth, and here ſhake hands, and caſt your ſtones againſt abuſers of <hi>Free-grace,</hi> if your ſide be not guilty of the like, or worſe. You have a watchfull eye to look into our waies; if in love to us, we thanke you. It might occaſion us at leaſt (if we had any unfeigned deſire, that the good and fair way of the Lord might not be evil ſpoken of) to walk more cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpectly: but if the word of Grace leaven not the heart, it will abide graceleſs. And I reſt perſwaded, that if it had not been either the licentious or looſe life of ſome, who are noted; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch as had been formerly wicked and prophane, did flock after Dr. <hi>Criſp,</hi> and attend to his Miniſtery, as they did, in <hi>Luke</hi> 15.1, 2. and that it was more glorious and effectual then others; elſe that you and your fellows would never have uſed tongue or pen againſt this way. My reaſon is, becauſe it is ſo clear and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyable, that having ſearched and ſifted it with all diligence, there is found no ſolid and material cauſe of exception againſt it: but all is reſolved into envy and prejudice.</p>
                     <p>As for that queſtion of juſtification before faith or after, I have ſpoken to it in anſwer to Mr. <hi>Burgeſs.</hi> It's true, God in his Goſpels-diſpenſation onely pronounceth the ſentence of abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the believer: for he dealeth in it with men of actual under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; and the main end is to quiet and comfort the conſcience; for which purpoſe faith is mainly uſeful, as to give glory unto God. But you grant, that the Covenant is with Chriſt, and all his Heirs and kindred in him: he being a publique perſon in whom all were acquitted; and that is ſufficient.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Reply.</hi> The queſtion is, whether the Lyon be a devouring beaſt? and you anſwer, He cannot actually devour, becauſe he is chained:
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53450:124"/>but doth chaining change his devouring nature? and ſo hath not the Law a condemning power ſtill, though it condemn not actually alway? you ſee power to do it, is not taken from it. That it did not condemn <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency, hath no more ſinew of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in it, then that the Law of the Land hath no power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn murther, becauſe there is no actual murtherer. It hath power to do it, but it is to exerciſe and put forth its power in a way of juſtice, that is, when the ſinne is actually committed. You ſay, (but they are vain words, without light or weight) that to condemn is accidental to a Law. I reply, as truely and in the like ſenſe, That to command and direct be as accidental: (ſo the whole of the Law, in all its parts and offices, ſhall be acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental) for the Law doth not actually rule and govern Lawleſs rebels: may not I then as ſolidly inferre, It hath no authority nor power to do it? yea, in Hell among the damned, as in our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, there is Law onely actually condemning and tormenting: but not ruling and directing in its way of holineſs. Laſtly, You ſhould prove that Chriſt hath removed the curſe from the Law: he hath redeemed his from under it, but left the Law with all the power it had. But you ſpeak what Mr. <hi>Burgeſs</hi> objected alſo. If need be, ſee more in Anſwer to his book. I muſe, that men of wiſdom and parts, will ſo fight and contend againſt ſo mnnifeſt truths. You grant the believer ſinneth dayly, and that every ſinne, yea leaſt omiſſion, is Hell by the Law; and thus he is dayly brought under reverence of Divine juſtice: now how can that be, and yet no condemnation or curſe left in the Law? Hell is but a fiction or a painted fire: the man need not fear it, though he ſinne: nor he need no Faith, nor Chriſt to preſerve and ſecure him. Thus one of your Tenets cutteth the nerves of another.</p>

                        <hi>Reply.</hi> 1. The way by which we can onely go and enter into Heaven, is that <hi>New living way</hi> dedicated by blood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.20, 21. In which way the ſoul can onely walk and continue by
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53450:124"/>believing. Hence it is ſaid, That <hi>through faith they inherite the promiſes,</hi> Heb. 6.12. He that walketh in Chriſt is holy, and walketh holily: but he walketh not in Chriſt by his holy life. <hi>As ye have received Chriſt, ſo walk in him,</hi> Coloſ. 2.6. In walking or living holily, we as it were move in another ſphere: by faith we live and walk in Chriſt, and in the way of peace and life, which is by his righteouſneſs: by love we walk the legal way of our own active righteouſneſs, ſaith <hi>Luther.</hi> Doth not the Scripture call us to come to Chriſt, to be found in him to abide, walk, and continue in him? All which can only be effected by faith. In this way the ſoul meeteth with the moſt and ſtrongeſt temptations and oppoſitions, which it reſiſteth and overcometh by faith alone, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8, 9. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.4. You tell us what the faith of Libertines is: It may be you know it, and what your own is to you; but if you cenſure and aſperſe them for Libertines who are not ſo, whoſe condemnation is that? be not ſo raſh in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: they ſtand and fall to Chriſt, not to you, <hi>Rom</hi> 14.4. And if your faith, which ſhould elevate and carry up the ſoul unto Chriſt, and the way of free juſtification by his grace, for continual peace, favour, acceptance, and everlaſting ſalvation, do yet let you ſeek, and labour to receive all in the way of your own works and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; it may well then be queſtioned, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.19, 20, 21. Further, your expreſſion is not home, but falleth ſhort, when you ſay, that Chriſt onely giveth a right to ſalvation. Chriſt and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation cannot be parted: you would place Chriſt in the beginning, ſalvation in the end, and your good workes maketh the way, and leadeth and guideth from Chriſt to ſalvation: this is your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity. But eternal life is in Chriſt, <hi>He that hath Chriſt, hath life,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.11, 12. You may as well ſay, A believer hath not Chriſt, but onely hath a right to him, now Chriſt dwelleth in the heart by faith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. And his Kingdom is in you, which is in righteouſneſs, peace, and joy in the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17. I am ſure if you find and walk in a holy and clean way, it is by faith, or rather the blood of ſprinkling <hi>cleanſeth</hi> and maketh your way undefiled before God, and no perfect obedience of yours. But ſpiritual things are ſpiritually diſcerned.</p>

                     <p>Mr. Rutherf. <hi>Dr.</hi> Criſp <hi>objects, Chriſt putteth forth a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral proclamation to all.</hi> Anſw. <hi>It's true, the Goſpel except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no man from pardon — but the promiſe of the Goſpel is not ſimply univerſal, as if God intended all and every ſhould be actually redeemed and ſaved.</hi> 2. <hi>It's moſt untrue that Chriſt belongeth to ſinners, as ſinners: for then Chriſt ſhould belong to all unbelievers, how obſtinate ſoever. Nay, Chriſt belongs onely to ſinners elected to glory — and to believing ſinners, as believing, in regard of actual union.</hi> 3. <hi>It's falſe that ſinners, as ſinners, receive Chriſt; ſo ſhould</hi> Judas <hi>receive him.

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reply.</hi> You know that Dr. <hi>Cr.</hi> ſpeaks onely of the proclamation and Goſpel-tender, which is to every creature, <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.15. and not of Gods intention, which he granteth is onely to gather and ſave the elect. Alſo you ſaid a little before, That the obligation of believing lyeth on all, yea though they be damned: ſo then the Goſpel is to be preached <hi>indiſcriminatim</hi> unto all, for the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.26.</p>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:53450:125"/>
                     <p n="2">2. You here again pervert and reſtrain his meaning: for he ſpeaks of the free tender of Chriſt unto all, and you ſay he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended onely to ſinners elected to glory. This argueth a minde diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to cavil, and to let nothing paſs without a Carp, how pure ſoever. Chriſt in the diſpenſation is to be preached and made known to unbelievers, that they may become believers. Goſpel findeth not men believers; it is well if it leave them ſo. Faith cometh by hearing, and after faith comes actual union.</p>
                     <p>To your 3. If ſinners as ſinners do believe, then as ſinners they receive Chriſt. For what is it to believe, but to receive Chriſt? <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. Your expreſſion is, <hi>Chriſt belongs to believing ſinners.</hi> To receive, is to take a thing offered or given, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> took unto himſelf <hi>Mary, Matth.</hi> 1.30. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.11.</p>
                     <p>To your 4. If ſinners be wearied and ſelf-condemned, are they not ſinners ſtill? Becauſe they are ſenſbly ſo, are they leſs ſo? or not formally ſinners? Prove that further. And though all be not ſo prepared or qualified, yet it's plain by your own confeſſion before, that they are bound to believe: the obligation lieth on them. 2. In tendering Chriſt to thieves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whoſo upon that ground or tender receiveth him, in ſo doing doth confeſs himſelf a thief: and if he were not ſelf-convicted and condemned, he would never believe, or receive Chriſt: for the end of the action is it, that putteth him upon the action: he believeth in Chriſt, or receiveth him, that he may be ſaved: therefore he ſeeth he is loſt, and cannot otherwiſe be ſaved. This is clear. But that expreſſion is moſt ſtrange, when you ſay, that <hi>ſinners remaining in that damnable ſtate do believe.</hi> For, 1. Can they poſſibly be out of that damnable ſtate before they believe; or any other way, but by faith in Chriſt? 2. Again, if they believe in Chriſt, can you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that they ſhall remain <hi>in ſtatu quo prius?</hi> What a falſe myſt is this, or vile duſt that you caſt before the eyes of people! but you are in the net, and your end is perceived. But what preparations would you deſire more, then that God ſhould give a heart to ſuch ſinners to come to Chriſt? a heart ſenſible of ſin, apprehenſive of danger, deſirous to be in a ſecure condition, and that is reſolved that peace and ſafety is onely in Chriſt, and by Chriſt? elſe the ſoul cometh not to Chriſt: and if it come not to him, it hath no encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement by Dr. <hi>Criſp</hi>'s Miniſtery. Do not condemn the innocent.

                        <hi>Reply.</hi> Here I obſerve a twofold failing. 1. In that the occaſion of theſe words, and unto which they relate, is concealed. Dr. <hi>Tai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi> ſaid, <hi>God looketh not on their obedience as theirs, but as it is his own work in them.</hi> Now then I grant it in a ſort to be his own work; but ſo it is paſſive to us: and ſo it muſt be, unleſs you put no difference between what the Spirit worketh in and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and what we work by the ſame Spirit: for here we act. And your dealing is not fair, in that you leave out the words <hi>in them;</hi> for ſo Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſaith, <hi>What the Spirit worketh is paſſive to them.</hi> But 2. ſee how you pervert this, and ſo infer as you pleaſe, <hi>That now it is ſacriledge for us to be holy, and to adde any of our active holineſs to Chriſts active obedience. Repl.</hi> The former Clauſe ariſeth not from my premiſes, as you cannot but ſee: unleſs this be the meaning, to make our ſelves holy; which is Gods work alone, not ours at all. And if you will adde our active holineſs to Chriſts, it is no other then ſacriledge, (though Mr. <hi>T.</hi> hath no ſuch words) for you ſteal and take from Chriſt, what you put to your own obedience.</p>

This is your inconſtancie. And if now you apprehend this to be the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and uſual temptation of a troubled &amp; dejected ſinner, deſirous of Chriſt, and would clear it, that ſelf-unworthineſs is no bar; why are you ſo invective againſt Dr. <hi>Criſp?</hi> Oh conſider, and be better adviſed. But it is improper, and unſcripture-like, to call hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation ſaving, as alſo inconſiſtent with ſelf-unworthineſs.</p>

Mr. <hi>Eaton</hi>'s words are, <hi>That Propoſition, that we are both righteous and ſinners alſo in the ſight of God falls flat to the ground.</hi> But he denieth us not to be ſinners in our ſelves, or that ſin remaineth and dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth ſtill in us, and that to our ſenſe and feeling.

And your own words immediately going before, do ſufficiently clear and acquit him. <hi>But</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Eaton</hi>) <hi>thoſe imperfections of our ſanctification are left in us to our ſenſe and feeling, that they may be healed in our juſtification.</hi> Is not this then a palpable and unjuſt charge?

In chap. 5. p. 96. of <hi>Honey-comb,</hi> you may read to your conviction and ſhame, Thus it is plain, that although God knows the ſin that dwells in his ſanctified children, yet he ſeeth them aboliſhed out of his own ſight.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Repl.</hi> This accuſation is as falſe and unjuſt as the former. I muſe you bluſh not nor conſcience did not make the hand to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble when you uſed it in this horrid charge. There are no ſuch words as, That ſin was <hi>inherently</hi> laid on Chriſt; or, that Chriſt was the perſon that really and truly did all theſe ſins, or was <hi>intrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally the ſinner.</hi> The moſt, and which cometh neereſt to theſe blaſphemies, is where he ſaith, That Chriſt was really and truly the perſon that <hi>had</hi> all theſe ſins, when they were laid on him; but not that he was the perſon that <hi>did them,</hi> as you ſay: The Lord charge you not with it. And as he urgeth rightly, Where doth Scripture ſay, that the guilt of ſin, and not ſin it ſelf, was laid on him? You grant as much (if you underſtand your ſelf) as he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerteth, <hi>viz.</hi> That as Surety, he was really and truly the debter, or ſinner; not the formal ſubject of ſin, in whom the blot of it was intrinſecally or really inherent: you can gather or infer no ſuch thing. You adde, <hi>It was by imputation.</hi> True: but that ſpeaks to the manneer how he was a ſinner, and not to the reality and truth of it: he was truly the ſinner, or debter, in regard of his office or condition, or Law-place, as you call it. 2. So then he was to anſwer juſtice. And 3. hereupon became he obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to make ſatisfaction by ſuffering. So that the Doctor reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth firmly. If he had not been firſt found to be the ſinner in law, or debter, not actively, that ever he committed any evil, (ſuch bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemy he denieth and abhorred) but paſſively, he being made the debter who muſt pay; God having laid the iniquities of his people upon him: and thoſe firſt laid on him, otherwiſe he had not ſuffered and ſatisfied for them. You cannot finde any bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemy, ſave what you made your ſelf, by exchanging and putting
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53450:128"/>in your own words: and who then ſtandeth guilty of it? If any underſtanding and indifferent minde, free from malice and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, had heard or read him, he would never have ſo perverted and miſ-interpreted, as you have done. But D. <hi>Luther</hi>'s words, if you yet do think him Orthodox, may be fully ſatisfactory, on <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Serio loquitur Propheta,</hi> &amp;c. The Prophet ſpeaketh ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, that Chriſt this Lamb of God ſhould bear the ſins of us all. But what is it to bear ſin? The Sophiſters anſwer, To be puniſhed. Well: but why is Chriſt puniſhed? Is it not becauſe he hath ſin, and beareth it? Now that Chriſt hath ſin, the holy Ghoſt wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. <hi>My ſins have taken ſuch hold on me, that I am not able to look up: they are moe in number then the hairs of my head.</hi> In this Pſalm he ſpeaks in the perſon of Chriſt, and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41. This teſtimony is not the voice of an innocent, but of a ſuffering Chriſt, who took upon him to bear the perſon of all ſinners. Wherefore Chriſt was not onely crucified and died, but ſin alſo, through the Divine love, was laid upon him: when ſin was laid upon him then cometh the Law, and ſaith, Every ſinner muſt die, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—God ſent his Son into the world, &amp; laid on him the ſins of all men, ſaying, Be thou <hi>Peter</hi> the denyer, <hi>Paul</hi> the perſecutor, blaſphemer, and cruel oppreſſor; <hi>David</hi> that adulterer; that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner who ate the apple in Paradiſe, that thief who hanged on the Croſs; and briefly, be thou the perſon which hath committed the ſins of all men: ſee therefore that thou pay and ſatisfie for them. Here, now cometh the Law, and ſaith, I finde him a ſinner, and that ſuch a one as hath taken on him the ſins of all men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let him die upon the Croſs: and ſo ſetteth upon him, and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth him. — Now ſin being vanquiſhed, and death aboliſhed by this one man, God would ſee nothing elſe in the whole world, if it did believe, but a meer cleanſing and righteouſneſs. And a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before upon the ſame 13 verſ. And this (no doubt) all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets did foreſee in ſpirit, that Chriſt ſhould become the greateſt tranſgreſſor, murtherer, adulterer, thief, rebel, and blaſphemer, that ever was or could be in all the world. Again: If it be not abſurd to confeſs and believe that Chriſt was crucified between two thieves, then it is not abſurd to ſay alſo, that he was accurſed, and of all ſinners the greateſt. You may read much more to like purpoſe: but this may let you ſee your partiality and errour. If
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53450:128"/>you can underſtand and conſtrue the one Doctor aright, why not the other alſo? except your minde be ſiniſter, or otherwiſe letted. And now, if you have any conſcience towards God, or love to the Truth and your Brethren, ſo much injured by you, you will clear them publikely, and accuſe your ſelf. By this I could eaſily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twiſt and annul what you have ſaid againſt us.</p>

But I perceive this to be your fundamental error: for from the want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the true nature and efficacie of this doctrine of Free-grace, have you raiſed all ſlanders. Chriſtian liberty is carnal licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to a Legal eye, a loveleſs apprehenſion, and a faithleſs heart. Such ſpirits as are not principled for it, cannot skill of it; and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceit breeds miſreports; and too much credulity is an eaſie inlet for the worſt you can ſay, into ſuch a minde as receives not the love of the truth. <hi>Grace is by him turned into wantonneſs</hi> &amp;c. Thus you bely him; and they that are not of the light, believe you: and hence is the overflowing of your gall, which hath ſo filled the veins and paſſages of your book with bitter invectives and falſhoods. If you had produced one clauſe rightly interpreted, crying down true holineſs in its due place, and for its proper ends, you might have had credit. Yet true Evangelical ſanctification will diſcover the vanity and unſoundneſs of Legal reformation. It is not all one, To ſerve in the oldneſs of the Letter, and in the newneſs of the Spirit. Alſo, Chriſt our righteouſneſs is the bond of union with God, by faith in whom we abide in God, and walk with him. We cannot deal immediately with God in our own holineſs.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, you think we are out of love with ſin onely for fear of an ill turn, and do not hate it as ſin: as if the love of God and the love of ſin could lodge in one ſoul; or the Spirit received by the hearing of faith, did not work and cauſe an antipathy and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety againſt ſinfulneſs: or that the chain of the Covenant of grace could be broken and one link or branch ſundered from another.
